"1","So no shit, there I was, hanging out with some old friends I hadn't seen in a while, enjoying a few beers (who am I kidding, way more than a few) and chatting.

Somehow, as it seems to often do, the conversation turned to reminiscing about our mandatory military service in the Finnish defense forces. Now, we all had vastly different experiences. 

We had served in a wide range of roles: Regular grunts, MPs, a field cook, a truck driver (yours truly), a tank commander, and a hi-speed low-drag recon guy. Some of us had greatly enjoyed our service, and remembered it with great fondness and nostalgia. Others were just glad that it was over and they would never have to do another march in full gear or sleep another night in a leaky tent. Most of us fell in the middle: Some parts really fuckin' sucked, some parts were pretty great, and while we didn't actively hate it we weren't in a hurry to do it again either. But there was one thing in particular that we all could unanimously agree on.

*The first couple weeks of basic were a chaotic, confusing mess.* And since that's an experience a lot of people here can probably relate to, I figured I'd write about it.

___

I can still remember the day I first walked through those gates. Even though my memory is generally so shit I can barely remember whether I've had lunch yet today, that day remains etched into my mind clear as crystal.

My dad had volunteered to drive me to the base, and spent the entire drive telling me horror stories of his own service 30 years prior. He seemed to be quite amused by how I grew visibly more anxious the closer we got to our destination. Thanks a lot, old man.

As we arrived, dad handed me my backpack and patted me on the back with a ""good luck, try to get back in one piece"" and sped off. I think only in the moment his car's tail lights disappeared around the bend did it truly sink in where I was and what I was about to get into.

The instructions given had been to arrive clean shaven, with hair pre-cut to regulation length, wear light, PT-friendly clothing and bring no personal possessions beyond the bare necessities. Most recruits (myself included) had obeyed these instructions, but a few clearly had not.

One guy showed up with a patchy beard and waist-length dreads, wearing a beanie and wool sweater (mind you, it was 27c/80f) and stinking so strongly of weed that I could smell it from across the parking lot. The MPs were not amused. Another waltzed in wearing a tan 3-piece suit, complete with a red tie and a leather suitcase under his arm. Yet another got the rest of it right but came in with an absolutely massive camping backpack, filled to the brim with who knows what.

We went through entry check (IDs and such), got sniffed by drug dogs (with a few lucky individuals getting to have a nice private chat with the MPs), had our bags checked for other contraband and were sent off to our companies.

At the company the next order of business was getting sorted into platoons and squads, getting familiarized with our barracks, our command and each other, and waiting for the last stragglers to arrive. Then off to grab our gear from supply, drag all our newly acquired gear (goddamn that sack was heavy) back to the barracks, and commence the Tetris of somehow getting it all to fit in our lockers, of course interspersed with lots and lots of ""hurry up and wait."" There was also a lot of running around like headless chickens, trying to find someone to swap with because clothing item X was way too big or too small.

As the cheapo piece of shit watch I had brought along had already died after only two hours, I couldn't tell the time, but at some point it was finally 9pm, meaning evening snack time. As it turns out, this snack consisted of a rock-hard piece of rye bread and a single slice of ham. When I asked my squad leader where the butter was, he only laughed.

I remember sitting on the edge of my bunk, gnawing on that bread and contemplating the decisions that had brought me here. My feet were sore as hell, I was exhausted, and the motherfucker on the bunk above mine had just ripped a fart so nasty it almost made me gag. And because I was far from the most social guy, I was starting to feel a bit mentally overwhelmed by having to be around other people all day. *Oh well,* I thought, *what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.*

As the lights out call came and I stretched out in my bunk, I remember thinking to myself something along the lines of, *Well, it hasn't been* **that** *bad so far. I wonder what tomorrow is gonna be like?*

Oh, how little I knew.

I tried to look it up, but I can't find anything prior to 2009 - and even that doesn't say anything about sex between service members.

Didn't matter to him how well you were doing in sales, he wouldn't let you off work without you sending a doctor's note to corporate and having corporate tell him to cut you.  And even then, he would call you multiple times a day to see when you were coming back in.

"13","The Rolling Stones were blaring their inability to get satisfaction out of the radio on the dash of the ’54 Merc as we blasted down the highway past the paper mill.

The 4-barrel carburetor had just been ‘adjusted’ with a piece of wire we snipped out of my buddy Dave’s fence.

Even though the monstrously heavy boat of a Mercury had a V-8 it only delivered 161HP so you had to let it wind up for miles before you could break over the 100MPH line on the speedometer.

The last year of our high school Dave and I had played together on the football team – his Dad was a coach – and now our time was spent cruising.

But the stigma of driving around in an old Merc left much to be desired so one day Dave, a wild hair at work, latched on to the idea that he needed a project - a proper car project – like a rebuild of an older classic into a hot rod.

Now this was 1966 and that 1939 Plymouth Road King for sale across town caught Dave’s eye.

It was love at first sight.

It ran pretty well but with that rank old horsehair stuffing in the bench seats I was sure Dave would not be getting any satisfaction back there when the restoration was complete.

That is, if he was, I didn’t want to see her…

We drove the Plymouth up to his home on the hill, the fine residential area overlooking town and put her in his garage.

Dave’s first order of business was to ‘tune her up’.

Of course, she already ran well enough but that seems to be what a man does when he is starting a major hot rod project.

So, we stripped out the plugs, re-gapped them, put in new points and a new condenser in the rotor distributor cap and proceeded to install the wires to the plugs.

At this point every kid born in the early to mid-20th century had the flathead 6 firing order memorized: 1-5-3-6-2-4

Well, every kid but us.

So, we finished her up – it was about 9PM on a cold winter’s night – and we took off out of his garage for a test drive around the block.

What a sight!

The thing backfired like a cannon shot, belching fire and flame out the exhaust pipe as we jerked and twitched down the road.

After returning home and straightening out the firing sequence our next project was to rebuild the old exhaust system.

The metal used in the original car had badly corroded and was covered with rust flakes and corrosion dust.

Laying underneath that thing with this stuff dropping into my eyes, mouth and nose was an introduction to hot rodding that left me with an unforgettable memory.

Especially when I asked Dave for the socket set that covered the U-bolt nuts holding the remnant of the exhaust system in place.

“Uh, I can’t afford those expensive tools. Here, use this crescent wrench”, Dave says and hands me an adjustable wrench that looked like it had been forged in the Civil War.

So I proceeded to bark every knuckle on each hand until I bled – mixing the reddish brown corrosion with my blood as I worked my way down the exhaust pipe.

When the project was over, I swore I was through hot rodding forever.

And I had a distinct hatred for any and all crescent wrenches.

A year and a half later I had completed 6 months of the US Navy's Polaris Electronics “A” School at Dam Neck, Virginia and was thrilled to have learned all about the mysteries of the electron. I was headed for the Submarine Force as a Missile Technician on a Polaris submarine.

I had just entered Polaris Missile “C” School and we were being introduced to the utterly fascinating world of missile flight control, guidance systems, thrust vector control, fire control, hydraulics and even pneumatics!

I loved all of it.

We had learned basic electronics but now we got to see how it all fit together in the real, practical world – and at the expense and by the hands of the best and brightest scientists and engineers in the world!

Why, the original Polaris guidance system had been designed by staff at MIT and here we were learning all about its inner workings.

What an honor and a privilege to be part of such an amazing array of science and electronics!

So, we finally got to the point where we were learning how to maintain the A-2 missiles using all manner of tools.

We were introduced to the US Navy’s favorite trick of designing their own tools for operations and procedures where Snap-On didn’t have a product.

So “Special Tool – XXX” became part of our lexicon and we learned what they were all for.

One day as I was lusting after the toolbox, rooting around in it just looking, I asked the Chief,

“Hey Chief – I don’t see any crescent wrenches in here – do we have any?”

The Chief went off like a bottle-rocket,

‘Sailor, we don’t have crescent wrenches in the Missile Compartment! We use the right tool and only the right tool for the job –***THERE ARE NO GODDAMNED CRESCENT WRENCHES!”***

Ah, a man after my own heart.

I tucked that piece of wisdom away for future use.

Now, truth is, I own a few today, but I am genuinely loathed to use them.

They round off the heads of bolts and destroy things faster than any other tool I own.

I am still haunted by that old salty Chief.

And today, another missile technician from another branch of the service is also haunted by using the wrong wrench for missile maintenance.

On September 19, 1980, at 0300 local time, an Air Force missile tech was performing routine maintenance on a Titan II missile in its silo in Arkansas. (This is unclassified and in the public domain).

Instead of using the USAF prescribed wrench for the task he substituted a socket and ratchet wrench (previously but no longer allowed) which came apart as he worked on the missile.

The socket fell down between the missile and the tube but was not caught by the rubber boot safety barrier that should have been in place per SOP down below for just such an accident. They never installed the rubber boot.

The socket penetrated the missile, an explosion then occurred that launched the 740-ton silo cover into the air and sent the 9-MT warhead sailing hundreds of feet away from the silo…

So, there you have it – the crescent wrench, a most versatile yet dangerous tool…","458"

"15","This story made me think of something completely different - along the same lines (like what I did there?), from my family. It was about 1987, which would have made me 16. I was very close with my maternal grandfather, Sam, who was 70 years old. Grandpa was going to the hospital for a procedure. I was of course, concerned. He told me there was no reason for concern, but wouldn't elaborate on what the ""procedure"" was. Now I was curious.

I worked for my parents, who owned a neighborhood grocery store &amp; deli. Normally I worked after school on weeknights, from 5pm to closing, with my paternal grandmother Doris. I worked weekends with Grandma Doris and my parents on weekends, with varying hours. 

Of course, I asked everyone what they knew. Grandma Rose, Sam's wife, wasn't giving anything more than the company line, ""no reason for concern."" Grandma Doris wasn't saying anything - I didn't know if she knew anything or not, and my parents said they had the same info as me, but let them know if I found anything out.

Sam and Rose lived in the country and used to come into town every couple of days to visit. They had well water that was safe, but didn't taste great, and smelled of sulfur, so they would fill water jugs at our house, next door to the store. Grandpa Sam also exchanged regular quarters for bicentennial quarters in our cash registers. Grandpa Sam and Grandma Rose won a 4' tall bottle of whiskey on their honeymoon (just after WWII). In 1976 they began filling the empty whiskey bottle with bicentennial quarters, and when full, they went to the bank and paid off their house with that extremely heavy bottle of quarters.

Grandma Doris and Grandma Rose talked when they met in town, and talked on the phone often when Sam &amp; Rose weren't in town.

Grandma Doris liked to knit &amp; crochet, and she had - been - working - FURIOUSLY at something for a few days....like she didn't come out of her house. When we stopped by to check on her, she just told us she was working on something, and in a nice grandmotherly way, told us to go away.

Finally, one Saturday morning in the spring of 1987, all was exposed....I don't know all the details, and once I found out the basics of the details, I didn't really want to know more. So for all you medical types out there, if I get it a bit wrong, sorry.

Grandpa Sam and Grandma Rose still liked to get it on (good for them!), but Grandpa found that he was having difficulty rising to the occasion. From what I understood at the time before Viagara, the options were a length of spring steel, resulting in a perpetual erection that I guess, you just had to kind of stuff in your wasteband, for the 97% of the time you didn't need an erection. The other option (Grandpa Sam's choice) was some sort of pump and release valve inserted under the skin in his thigh, with a hydraulic erection giving device in the part that periodically needed to stand at attention, resulting in a the ability to pump himself up for the event, then release the ""hydraulic pressure"" when an erection was no longer desired.

Apparently, the doctor advised Grandpa Sam that, while he could use regular bandages on his thigh, he should use a soft sock, or something similar, to cover and protect his penis for a couple weeks, until the incision healed. The grandmother's talked. On the first visit to town after the procedure, Grandma Doris presented Grandpa Sam with 28 knitted penis booties, complete with elastic, adjustable drawstrings, to make sure the booties didn't fall off.  Grandma Doris used the softest yarn available, and made sure he had enough to change them out a couple times a day, if needed. Grandma Doris then apologized...While she imagined that she probably got the sizing right, they'd have to let her know if any adjustments would be necessary.

Now this (presentation) didn't go down in the retail store area, it was in the office. I could hear them talking, but not what they were saying, and could see my dad sitting in his office chair, staring slack-jawed in the direction of his mother, on the other side of the office. I couldn't see any of my grandparents or my mother. I heard Grandma Rose start laughing, then my mom came out of the office, laughing her ass off, and left the store. Grandpa Sam came walking out next, a small bag in his hand, beet red and in an apparent daze. He went over to our house to get their water jugs, carried them partway to his truck, put them down, went back to our house for a few minutes, then got in the truck and left. My dad came out, shaking his head, looked at me and said ""OMG - your grandmother."" I asked which one, he said ""my mother."" I asked what happened. He didn't answer, but started laughing as he left the store. My mom walked back in, and when there were no customers, she told me everything, and we had a good laugh, but then I told her that Grandpa left. Grandma Rose came out and asked where Sam was. I told her that he left. She rolled her eyes and went back to the office, a little irritated that he left her there.

We were all a bit concerned, but Grandpa Sam came back about 10 minutes later. He said he was initially so embarrassed that he forgot his quarters, his water jugs, and his wife, and started to go home, before realizing he was alone. He went back into the office and thanked Grandma Doris for the gift, and that they would work fine.

I initially felt bad for his embarrassment, but it was really funny. My family is very open, sometimes too open, about a lot. A couple days later, Sam and Rose were back for their water, quarters, and family visit, and they were both in good humor. Grandpa laughed about how both grandmother's might get along a little too well.","473"
"16","Seriously, just teach your male offspring how to scrub their penis; there's no need to mutilate it.

Genuine medical reasons are a separate issue, of course, but chopping bits off without that? Just fucking no.","527"

Cleaning my penis has never been ""not really an option"" for me, including the 2 decades spent serving on submarines, where water was often limited.

"18","&gt;Dad's company was awarded the Vietnamese Gallantry Cross for that action. He's more proud of that medal than any others, though.

That so? It's funny how awards vary from their official meanings. I got an individual CoG/Bronzestar from the ARVN regiment I was assigned to. I value that one over and above some of the medals I got from the US Army. Was a nod, and a token of friendship and gratitude. I was the only American they knew who was not there to teach them anything. My job was to give them access to US Army artillery, and I did. They noticed.

The only NVA/VC who helped me was a former sapper who had *Chiêu-Hồi*'ed his way into giving demonstrations to American soldiers just how easy it was to slip through triple-tiered concertina wire. Was a good demo and a good thing to know. Gave me some appreciation of tanglefoot wire, which came in handy later.","554"

"21","I lurk here a lot because a lot of my uncles and father served in the service and I've heard a lot of funny stories so I thought I'd share. 

My uncle John is one of the hardest working guys I know. He went into the air force as young as he could and did 30 and retired doing telecommunications. This was way back in the 70s and 80s.

Anyway, he got into the business of splicing coax for telecommunications companies and called me up when I was in my early 20s to come down to Florida and splice cable with him for good money. This was early 2k so the internet was taking off and all media companies was hiring all kinds of subcontractors to splice in the new equipment. Me as a single man working on a framing crew building houses jumped at the chance at making big money. After being out there a couple of months he told me a funny story.

The story.. When John got assigned to his barracks he walked in and met his roommate Dan. Dan had come from the showers and had those little towels around his waist that the air force gives you. John said he could see the man's tip protruding from the bottom of the towel. My uncle being a very unfiltered guy was in just amazement and straight up asked ""is that your cock!? "" Dan said it was and all he could say was ""Jesus Christ! How big is that thing?"" Dan quietly said ""around 10-11inches.."" My uncle was obviously intrigued so he asked him a bunch of question and assumed he got laid all the time. Dan totally changed his perception. He said he couldn't keep partners because he was too big. He always felt like a side show because girls would want to see it but would never have sex with him so he got laid the least of all of his friends. My uncle is very outspoken so he makes a great wing man so he felt his mission was to get Dan laid and he concurred that anytime he got Dan a date the girl wouldn't sleep with him.


Now on to a funny event. John and Dan and other friends were playing basketball at the gym on base and they were getting smoked by a all black squad from a different set of barracks. When John and his team were walking off the court one of the three other guys made the comment ""get off the court little dick white boys!"" John pipes up and said ""yea you beat us but there is no little dicks here so shut your mouth"". The other team broke out in laughter and said it again. John in fashion said ""you wanna bet?"" The other team said they would gladly do so. So John's team pooled together about 100 bucks and bet the other guys that they couldn't produce a dick bigger than theirs. They accepted. (thinking back on this it all sounds extremely gay but this is how it was told.) So the other team had a Major named Grimes who pulled his shorts down and produced a very respectable 8-9 inch flaccid cock. Dan then steps up and looks down on the majors dick and said flatly ""you call that a dick? “ then pulls his shorts down to expose his trouser snake and everyone went quiet. Then after about 5 seconds Grimes said ""you ain't right man"" and everyone busted out laughing. John said even though the guy couldn't get a win any weekend  he got a win that day.","616"

"31","In 1994, I was in the Army, stationed at Fort Davis, Panama. 
At that time, I had a roommate named John Parker (not real name) from Texas.  Parker was one of my best friends, and a terribly funny, smart, really weird guy.  Not weird in a bad way, just weird in a really interesting way.  He wore cherry red Doc Martens, shaved his head, had tons of tattoos, and drank wine.
One day, this kid Vickers in our platoon started calling Parker, ‘Gimpy’ and it forever became Parker’s nickname.

Outside of our barracks, we had a volleyball court/sand pit.  About ten of us were playing volleyball one Saturday afternoon.  During the game, Gimpy dropped to his ass and started doing a butt scoot in the sand.  He was screaming, as we were all laughing at him.  We had no idea what Gimpy’s problem was.
Turned out, Gimp pivoted his foot wrong in the sand, and his big toe came off.
I swear.  Gimpy’s big toe tore off and was hanging. You could see the bone sticking out of his foot.
Luckily, Gimp was surrounded by professional soldiers, all well-qualified in first aid and combat lifesaving.  We completely ignored this training as we instinctively gawked at the wound, then posed with it for pictures.
Gimpy went to Gorgas Army Hospital for a few days.  While he was there, I drank his wine, and listened to his Skinny Puppy and Revco CD’s.  He came back fine, after walking around with a cane for a while.
I have told this story a hundred times, and nobody believes that a dude’s toe can come off playing volleyball in a sand pit.
Today, my old roomdog, Johnny The Gimp Parker texted me the photo to prove it all.

Fine, I'll write up the story. But you're also gonna have to read a bunch of backstory. I kind of chaptered it so skip to the coin part or the SMA part if you just want that. Most of it is about my first couple months at fort bliss and my time with the afgani refugees. 


 I just got back from the hospital and am procrastinating summoning the energy to go to the gym and lift things. So instead I'll exercise my memory and tell the story of why I started cutting up wood and making PFC coins and why I'm still doing it today. 

I arrived at my first duty station of Fort Bliss in 2021 in July. A few days after I showed up I was put directly on ammo guard duty at Mcgregor, 24 hours on 24 hours off. I was supposed to be there for a week but the unit that was to relieve us never showed up. So I was there for two weeks. Finally got off that detail with far too many pictures of tarantulas that tried to start beef like I wasn't gonna lose instantly. 

3 days at the company I went to the range for a week. Got back. A week passed and I finally did my first Monday runday after a month at my unit, 5 miles racing my PSG to obtain the title of fastest in the company. I won, but couldnt walk right for days, he was fine. He won. Then Friday the situation with Afghanistan happened. We were supposed to go to korea in a few months. The refugees were coming to el paso. My first conversation with my first sergeant was me demanding to be put on the detail, I didn't know anything about it. I said I do not care if I am filling sandbags I want to be there before they even arrive. I honestly do not remember why I was so passionate about it. But it didn't matter, my unit was assigned the job. Exclusively. I had started dating someone and it was going well, then we started our shifts. 12 hours on, 12 hours off. With a 45 minute bus ride there every day. Most went to set up the covid testing site, I was put on the covid quarantine site. 

The first few days were just preparing for them to arrive, we were excited and scared. I'm from south Carolina and never met anyone who didn't speak English or Spanish. I was excited. I refused any days off for the first two weeks. My budding relationship died about three days in lol. Such is life. 

OPERATION ALLIES WELCOME: Before the afganis even landed I wanted to be able to provide things I didn't believe the army would (for some reason I lacked trust) and started calling businesses all over el paso. I'd determine something I wanted, then call up businesses and ask if they had any extra. I got yoga mats for prayer rugs the first day from yoga studios. The second day I went after diapers, clothes, and toys. I collected about 300 diapers, 21 mats, and a mishmash of baby clothes before being ordered to stop by my commander. I waited until the unit had their own system for taking in donations and turned them all in. 

Only one person ever tested positive for my entire time on that part. A wild man we named Bashir because he would only accept the food we brought him if he had three milks, 4 teas, 3 jellies. He didn't know any English so he would put horns on his head and say ""Bashir Bashir Bashir"" when we didn't bring him enough. We googled it and it actually meant goat but close enough. I have stories about this man that are amazing but I'm not about to tell them, cuz he does not represent the guests to me even if it was the first person we'd met. 


Because there was nothing for us to do, we got assigned the job of carpentry. We came onto the site to PILES of planks and tools. Absolutely genius idea honestly. Took 3 days before they turned quarantine into builder bobs covid show. We built little work tables and spent 12 hours of night shift making so many things. Laundry lines, soccer goals, benches, privacy dividers for the tents, you name it. Actually I just did, that's pretty much it. I still have a huge scar/callous on my palm from 4 million spliters going into that one spot I was digging out with a knife for months. I loved it, I was miserable, I stank, I hurted, but I just refused to take any breaks because I have no clue why honestly. Ego? It was the literal first time in my life I'd experienced genuine hard labor and hard work. I was addicted. 

After a week the brass started getting helicoptered in to get tours by the huddles of officers telling them about all the great work they'd done and leading away from the things that they didn't want them to see. We were the first thing they passed on the way into the site. I learned to guess the number of stars by the number of helicopters landing at once. This major who would show up a couple hours before day shift, would always try and get us to work extra hard when the wigs of big would walk by. I remember him asking me to move the entire working site around the one building we hid from the sun behind, because he wanted them to see us. Rather than do that I dragged an already completed laundry line stand right into the open, grabbed a notebook and a tape measure and pretended to take measurements from it while wearing my eyepro and gloves we never wore. Like the fuckin tape measure was going to thwip back and measure the inside of both my eye sockets. Just for the 40 seconds this general was parading by, literally never looking at us as I watched this major run into the swarm and point at me. 

Every day we got the same speech from the high rank officers from our unit who we would watch drive up for the duration of the star parade hours, then come up to us and say ""you guys have been doing a kickass job, really knocking it out of the park"" then hop back in the 4×4 and drive back home for the day. 

Then we got moved from our little wood safe haven as the Combat engineers stole it from us. And were put into the security points (SPs) with the population of guests. Thus began the most infuriating and amazing time of my life. 

The kids, the fucking kids. The absolute agony of the day and the memories I hold the closest to my heart. If you had an energy drink they'd come up take a sip and put it back where they found it. I'm still convinced I caught dysentery from one of them, and had to mop up shit I sprayed across my room when i woke up in an absolute panic sprint to the bathroom. Also when I found out I had gained a roommate. Great meeting. Couldn't leave bed for days. Spent the first day at the camp laying on the ground in the sun and sand too dizzy to even move going in and out of consciousness. Having officers and ncos come up about to yell at me before being told ""woah woah woah he's fucked up"" and me trying to get up til they saw my face and all said ""Jesus fuck lay back down."" Also a kid stole my sunglasses from my pocket while I was asleep. The kids made me determine two things, I do not want a son. And I absolutely want a daughter some day. I tear up talking about one kid who I absolutely loved. Omar, who was the hustliest of hustlers. He would sit in the defac line that was always a mile long, get almost to the front and walk back 20 spots and ask for 2 dollars for his spot. Then he'd do it again and again and come up and show me his money. I loved this kid. I bought him a PC and got his name sewn on it and awarded him the hat and a coin (which I'll get to in a sec). He wore that shit every single day. We taught him to march, commands, gave him ranks to wear but he only ever wanted to be a PFC like me and his other soldier brothers. He was with me there every single day til he left. He hugged me and cried so long i fell asleep three times.

[The inside because I knew he'd get chased by soldiers thinking he stole someones.](https://i.imgur.com/KPpkKxd.jpg)

We got moved to the store front, where the donations would be given out to guests who waited in the longest line on this planet. This was the crowning jewel of the camp so all the brass would come. Endlessly. and thus the battalion commander and the ambitious officers were always there during the day. Daily ""you're doing a kickass job out here, really knocking out of the park guys""


LINES: holy heck the lines. Lines there were the absolute enemy of the guests and the soldiers. Cutting was just normal for them and the greatest sin on this planet to leaders. I was called so many names by officers and ranks because I wouldn't yell at them. Then I just started to do it, I learned how to flip the ol DS switch and became the problem solver for our team. They'd just point and I'd get them out. 

I did not like this, so I did the natural thing: I sought out an English teacher. I found him literally the next day I decided to. It was absolutely wild. He came to the store when it was closed and we talked while I told him it was closed. I learned he was a English professor with his own school in Kabul. I offered to get him little things he needed, like a jacket from walmart, a phone charger, just small stuff. And also prepare him for American culture. I had two friends in the camp, including him that were similar ages to me, and they mostly wanted to know how to date, and how to specifically date white women. In exchange he reversed his lesson plan and gave me an hour long lesson every day in farsi. I had a notebook of notes and the alphabet and practiced constantly. I become the translator. Point at them in the line and I'd step in and actually figure out what the problem was. I didn't get conversational but I could ALLMOST read. It felt like my brain was melting. They always laughed at my accent. 


WHY THE COINS:
I decided I absolutely despised officers. I'd literally only seen them in the most high visibility locations at the camp. We seemed to be the A-team apparently, always moved right when the next big thing opened. We would work and freeze almost to death or sweat to death and heard about our asskicking and parks constantly. But we were told we aren't getting any award for the 6 months we spent there, without any breaks. A day off every week, or every couple days, every 2 days. It changed weekly. I had sunburnt eyeballs several times. The amount of suicides was never mentioned, not a single one was given a wake. I had several NCOS begin divorce proceedings because of the hours they put in because they had to. Every month told we were gonna be replaced gonna be replaced gonna be replaced by another unit. Never happened. Our unit refused to pass it on because they wanted the promotion and full praise. When I arrived, reception was the closest thing I had experienced to fort blisses unit til 2022. CSM Williams came up and said ""people first"" and I legitimately believed him. On the camp they did not do a single thing for the mental health of the soldiers during the time. So many awful stories I won't say here. 

We did a lot of good, I loved being there. Putting in the long hours and basically living there. My barrack room really felt like a middle man to the bus and the bus again because I never remembered ever actually being in it. 


FINALLY GODDAMN THE COIN PART, YOU JUST WANTED TO GUSH ABOUT THE CAMP. 

I hated officers and their goofy cheer up chants, and I wanted to do literally anything. So I decided to make coins. The brass in my unit would just walk around to the parts they knew the big boys were going to see, so I wanted to originally get river rocks and engrave them beautifully and give them to them. Just too big to put into their pants pocket so only their cargo pocket. Where as they walked they'd give them belt rash on the other side and scrape their legs as it moved in their pocket. 

Obviously I chose wood instead cuz rocks expensive. I designed the PFC coin by sending my brother shitty doodles and Clipart and asking him to put it together in Gimp.

[Other side](https://i.imgur.com/Wo2yPcM.jpg) [The doodle](https://i.imgur.com/JEpoCta.jpg)

Called up a woodshop in town and asked him for advice. That man is now a really great friend of mine, have helped each other on all kinds of wierd tasks. I bought a plank of wood that he recommended, soft maple. Cut it at the new wood shop on camp, and got it engraved the next day. I made 15 of these things. 

[One side](https://i.imgur.com/aKyrbeW.jpg) [Another side](https://i.imgur.com/s2JlMbL.jpg)

They are heavy, wide, and I sanded the sides with a rock to give them a mild edge. You can't fit them in your pocket, only the cargo and only sideways. While they walk around they are gonna get home with a red rash on their thigh. I know, because I fuckin had one every day cuz I kept one in the holster at all time. Karma irony whatever

Me and my friends thought they'd get angry and understand the instant insult of a PFC giving them a coin. I gave it to a W03 at first and he loved it. Same speech every time. 

""Youre doing a kickass job out here, really knocking it out of the park, and I want to bestow upon you the highest honor I can...the Coveted PFC Coin ""

Mildly offended, I gave it to another officer, a captain

""Youre doing a kickass job out here, really knocking it out of the park, and I want to bestow upon you the highest honor I can...the Coveted PFC Coin""

He loved it too. 

So then I just went hog wild. Daring myself to give it to higher and higher ranks. At our SPs around the store we had radios given to us literally judt to tell each other and the officers inside the tent when someone with a rank came onto the site so we could all shape up. So I just used that same system. When I heard the call, I'd quickly run around and grab privates and get a herde. Figure out where they were and where they were going and cut them off. 

LTCs and colonels turning corners and finding themselves in the middle of a semicircle of privates. I'd step out and say that beautiful speech. Offer my hand never break eye contact and slap that big hunk of wood into theirs. 

I gave them to CSMs, birds, offered it to a 2 star who said no with disgust, gave it to a British General. Big ranks didn't scare me, they were exciting. And I terrified my leaders because they couldn't say anything about it because they all loved it. None of them knowing it was my personal, planned out, middle finger. My friends on the SPs fucking loved the coin prank. The best part was that I never changed the speech. And I always did it. I didn't care if the man walking the Colonel was a Colonel I gave one to yesterday. That was my favorite situation

[British General. I got told he was leaving the site and literally sprinted like a quarter mile into the desert after him and yelled HEY!](https://i.imgur.com/SKuJc5Z.jpg)

MY BATTALION COMMANDER

I awarded one to my battalion commander, had to ask my CSM who took a look at it and laughed. 

""What is OEW?""

""Uh CSM, that's our operation right?""

""Nope it's OAW, Operation Allies welcome, anyways I'll get the commander"" and disappeared into his office. I shatted my pants. I immediately started thinking about sharpie-ing it which wouldn't work. Then I thought ""change the acronym"" 

I got the first two words and my buddy came up with the last one like an angel 

Seconds later I awarded it to him in front of a crowd of everyone CSM gathered and the BC smugly said ""I'll make sure to cherish my oEEw coin""  so I said ""um actually sir, that stands for Operation Enlisted Woodshop"" ""YOU PLANNED THAT?"" ""Of course sir it's my coin.""

Fast forward changing the coins to represent the new name of the operation. Handing them out like candy, making more in my spare time. 

SMA GRINSTON

The SMA was coming. And on my day off. I immediately started getting teased ""gonna give him one too Bud?""

Yup

Came in on my day off, got a copy of his schedule for the day....somehow. Decided on a tent he would definitely be at and I'd definitely be able to get to him. He was having dinner and a conversation with soldiers from each battalion of my brigade. I wasn't picked ofc. But that day there was 60mph winds and a dust storm. The shoddy doors of the wedding tents we used didn't latch so when the wind came they were always getting thrown around. For this dinner they had a guy sat there holding the door shut and the sand outside the entire day. 

I went up to him and told him that he was relived and needed in the store tent and took his spot. Of course he absolutely never came back. Perfection. I sat there holding that door all day through the wind and sand. I actually cut my cornea on a piece of sand and spent the day with one eye shut. Wouldn't leave my door. Shift changed and a guy came to relieve me, I just said nah I got it go away. 

CSMs started wandering around the area scouting out the tent making sure everyone was good for his arrival. By this point all of them knew me and knew exactly why I was on that door. I got so many ""sooo pfc, what are you planning."" I had my brigade CSM directly and immediately warn me ""do not fucking do it."" I stayed on my door, sad. I got relieved and pulled into another tent to meet my battalion ops CSM. He gave me a coin and said ""good luck, you got this.""

All the damn support I needed. Went right back out and took my door. When he came by and went into the tent, it wasn't my time. I held the door shut literally with every muscle i had. While time trying to fight with my notebook and practice reading farsi off the sign to pass the time. Pages got ripped such is life. Random major started talking to me about my notes and took a picture of what i thought was my notebook for later. Nah he took the most gremlin photo of me possible with me hunched over holding the notebook out and the door shut and put it on the 2nd BDE page. He was a PAO. 

FINALLY the dinner ended. SMA gave a coin to everyone in the tent and came out and went straight to me surrounded in a pool of CSMs and said 

 ""they told me I had to give a coin to the door guy too""

And slapped a coin into my hand. I kept the grip and said 

""That's crazy SGM because I have something for you too, and slapped one into his other hand. 

""What the fuck is this?""

""That's the Coveted PFC coin SGM""

""I will Covet this""

And disappeared into his herde and left. 

I saw my BDE CSM staring at me and I fucking immediately full tilt sprinted to my car and left. Avoided him like the plague the rest of OAW. 


THATS IT. That's the whole story. All that buildup backstory and especially a full day's work on my day off, having a fucked up eye for 2 days. All for a 4 second prank. It's a dumb story. It's why I left all that OAW on there. That was a fun moment. But it's so attached to the amazing and life changing time that mission was for me. I really felt like I had become someone different and given tools to become someone different. 

After that I didnt care about the coins cuz like, where else was there to go. The prank was done. I won. 

Then I started doing the bone marrow drive, and the story for that is my first post. I started making SPC coins, and at first they were just to be given to the captains of the companies at each battalion I spoke to. That was too expensive and they had become something a bit more special to me. They reminded me of that prank, and still do. But now I give them to officers and ncos who genuinely care and do things that make my job running these drives easier. Going against the impression I had before when I first got into the real army.

"36","OP, I clicked through to read your other posts, and I want to say THANK YOU.
(This is related to other posts,  not the above story. Which is amazing and all, but I had to get this out.)

At the risk of making this all about me (but I promise this will circle back eventually), I’m going to give you some background. 

I’m not, nor was I ever in the military. But family members and friends have been, and I think I can actually count connections of various kinds to almost all of the services (missing only Space Force). One of those is my twin sister, who earned a spot at the Air Force Academy. That was over 30 years ago, and the environment there was less than welcoming to women. The hazing was a large part of her decision to leave long before graduation, but that also “legalized” her relationship with her boyfriend, a recent Academy grad at the time, who is now my brother in law.

They lived what I figure is a fairly typical military family life, transferring in and out of the country with their children (and I recognize some of the places from stories I’ve read here). BIL retired from the AF a few years back and started a second career. He, my sister, and their now adult children are chasing their dreams, including competing in track cycling at the National and international levels. 

But 11 months ago, sister started having some weird health issues. After a couple of trips to urgent care, she was told to go to the hospital next time, where they could run more tests. She did. And was diagnosed with an acute form of leukemia. It was a gut punch to everyone. We never expected the most fit member of the immediate family to get such a serious diagnosis. And it was serious- sister told us later that the doctors said if she had gone in 2 days later, there would have been nothing they could do.

But to circle back around (finally), she was lucky in that our third sister was an extra-bonus match for a transplant. Most of the family is too old at this point to join donor lists, though my niblings from sister and BIL have (and apparently one has popped up as a match for someone). So as someone whose family would be very much changed without the medical marvel of marrow/stem cell transplants, THANK YOU for your work to add to the donor lists.","725"
"37","

It was a cool and wet December day off the coast of North Carolina at Camp Lejeune in December of 1982. I had just gotten out of trouble for telling a Chief to perform oral sex on me. Had gone from being the Coxswain of an 80 ton Mike Boat hauling Marine tanks to the beach, back to running the deck of an LCU that carried 3 tanks. Minus my E-4 Chevron, the Skipper busted me to E-3.


I was at the back of the boat on the controls of an anchor we dropped to help pull the 350 ton landing craft off the beach when it all started. I could not see but I knew something was wrong by the way the boat's stern was wanting to pull towards the beach. Had been here once or twice.


Before I got the order, I started to bring in the cable which was attached to the anchor. You really did not want that 2 inch cable getting caught in either the screw or the shaft. Still, we kept swinging towards the churning surf. We were going to broach sideways on that beach and there was no stopping it.


At the time we had loaded two trucks and two artillery pieces before we started to broach. After we secured the anchor and as I got near the front of the boat I felt the first shudder as the boat started bouncing on the sand. Then there was a loud bang and the boat shimmied as waves picked up the 10 ton ramp and dropped it. Everyone on the boat felt it. I rushed forward only to find the ramp winch had stopped working. It was not responding to the controls. I opened the hatch to the compartment where the winch was and it was obvious what happened. The smell told me the winch had burned out. It had to be hand cranked to bring it up. 100 revolutions to raise it 1 inch and it had to come up almost 15 feet.


As the boat bounced in the sand, it started to get off the beach. The craftmaster did a good job getting the craft turned. Unfortunately when he turned into the waves the inoperable ramp started causing problems. It was possible we could lose it. The waves would pick up all 10 tons of it then let it slam down hard over and over. It seemed the ocean got rougher each passing minute and Davy Jones wanted that ramp.


The vehicles had not yet been secured so there was no choice in turning around and getting them off the boat. It had to be done. The craftmaster timed it well and buried that ramp in the sand as the waves lifted it, then the trucks were able to disembark. That's when the real trouble started. As the boat turned to get off the beach again, a series of huge waves hit us pushing us sideways leaving us sitting in the sand, high but far from dry. We were stuck. Good for the ramp, bad for the boat.


The waves kept pounding into the port side of the boat causing all 350 tons to rock in the surf. It got to the point we were going to need help getting off the beach. The Amphibious SeaBee Unit had a 30 ton bulldozer there. They tried to push us off the beach to no avail. After a half hour it was decided to get another boat to attach a tow line and pull us off. The tide was going out and time was short.


It was a simple job. Put on a life jacket then have two lines tied to me so I could go outside the sterngate to attach a 30lb shackle to the tow line. Typical Bostswain's Mate stuff. Most everyone in my rate had done something like that before. You just embrace the suck, do your job, and move on to the next one when you are a Deckape.


We got off the beach, the other LCU pulled us off and had us floating in minutes. Was only one problem. We were informed over the radio we had a huge hole in our starboard aft quarter. The bulldozer driver never told us he tore open our boat.


Being the shitbird at the time and most everyone else concerned with the ramp, it was up to me to find out how bad it was. I dropped down the scuttle into a small compartment between the engine room and the aft spaces where I opened the hatch.


I knew immediately it was pretty bad. When I opened the hatch, the water pressure behind it forcefully pushed the hatch open allowing the water to pin me against the bulkhead below the surface. I may have pissed myself at that point, not really sure. It could have been the adrenaline coursing through me as I was temporarily trapped underwater in a flooded compartment. 


In seconds that seemed like minutes, the pressure subsided and I was able to enter the compartment that was only 4-5' in height. It was very bad. A 5 foot long by 3 foot high opening in after steering. Half of it below the waterline. I waved at the other boats through the hole. Even swam out of the hole to see the damage from that view. By the time I got back on deck by climbing up the side of the boat, we had other reports of water leaking into compartments forward.


After searching the entire starboard side we found 5-6 other small holes which were easily fixed with wooden conical shaped damage control plugs. Just pound them in with a sledgehammer and it will stop the leak.


Then we had to focus on the large hole. No way the parts and equipment we needed was going in the small hatch. All the wood, metal, braces, and other equipment had to come through the hole from the outside with the help of another boat. Two of us went down to repair the boat. Once we had everything we needed, they closed the hatch behind us and we did what sailors have done since people went to sea. Fix the fucking hole. That is one hell of a feeling hearing that hatch close behind you as you entered a flooded compartment. We were trained for this though. 


After beating the jagged steel mostly flat with sledgehammer then putting up one section of wood over the hole, we started jamming mattresses and blankets around the edges. After a second layer over that, braced to where ever we could, the two of us stopped enough water for the pumps to keep up. 


Problem solved? Nope.


Just as we got back to within 300 yards of the ship our engines started to sputter then they died. We found out later that water went up the air vent to the fuel tank due to lack of preventive maintenance long before I got there. The ship managed to get lines on us and pull us into the welldeck. It was a rough entrance. With no control, the rolling waves had their way with the boat sending us crashing into the batter boards inside the welldeck. It was the fastest I ever saw a ship's deck go from flooded to dry during my three years at Assault Craft Unit-2.


After seeing the boat dry, we did a pretty good job of fixing her. Just like they taught us. I was going to get put in for a NAM which was amusing. Go from Captain's Mast to getting a Naval Achievement Medal in just over four weeks. Plus I had just reenlisted a few months prior to telling that Chief to play my skin flute.


We worked all night repairing the boat with the professional help of the Ship's Company on LPD-1, USS Raleigh. Had to drain our fuel tanks and refill but we were we were ready to get underway for operations before sunrise. Then the next morning came and the previous day was forgotten. It only gets worse from there. 


The next day started off as the previous one. It was a cold, wet, Coastal North Carolina December morning. We were all tired from working all night repairing the boat from the previous day's adventures. As the Senior Chief said, ""it was a great Navy day"". He had no idea what was coming. Neither did I, if I had there is no doubt I would have swam ashore then run for the hills.


We had been sent to a different ship to pick up three M-60 tanks then proceed to the beach. We married up to the back of an LST, a tank landing ship to load. The type that can actually land on the beach itself and unload once it extends its ramp. 


It was not too bad out on the water, rolling 4 foot seas. That made it tougher to load but we had done it in far worse conditions. It was timing, move the tank when the ship is in the trough of the wave. We got them on-board for the short ride to the beach. 


The Craftmaster had already told me an Engineman would be on the anchor. He wanted me on the ramp controls to show the new seamen once again how to lower the ramp and bring it back up. Quite often when a boat hits the beach, sand will build up on the ramp. You must wash that sand off by lowering it as the boat turns or else the winch can burn out as it did the day before.


Everything was going as it should when we approached the beach. I had cracked the ramp open just enough for me to see over top of it without the waves causing it to move.


There are a lot of sandbars off the coast there. Our flat-bottomed boats usually scoot right over them, this one was big enough to slow us down more than usual. It felt like we hit the beach. Seconds later we did.


To go back a few hours. Around midnight a Flight Surgeon wanted a ride to the beach, he had never ridden a landing craft. No problem. High tide came close to the First-Aid Station so they moved it to within 50 yards of where we landed. Not counting the two new people, we were an experienced crew trained to handle any situation. It was cloudy but clear enough for air ops.


The driver of the first tank was a cherry straight out of tank school. He thought we had indeed touched down and released his brakes after being told to keep them on until myself or another seaman said otherwise.


This next part kind of sucks, especially for me. If you are squeamish, stop here. You know what is coming. The worst part? I remember every second.


After we crossed over the sandbar a wave picked up that 350 ton boat loaded with 150 tons of tanks and pitched us onto the beach, hard. The tank driver thought we were already on the beach so when he started to roll he tried to hit his breaks but only stopped one tread. That made the tank pivot and pin me against the hatch that led to the ramp winch.


I say pin me but I had no idea at the time that in reality it crushed me. 


At first I did not know what happened, I could not move. Looking over at the seaman I was training I saw the look of horror on his face. I heard the Craftmaster scream, ""move that fucking tank."" That is when I looked over my shoulder and saw the tank.


""Fuck"" is all I could get out as the tank started to reverse. The seaman grabbed me and sort of peeled me off the tank, I was stuck to the tread. He got me down on the deck and the crew had all of our medical supplies out before the Flight Surgeon got to me. 


I knew it was bad. ""Oh fuck, mother-fuck, and shit"" was what I heard from my shipmates. Still, they knew what to do. At one point I thought that I had died. A spector dressed in black climbed over the side of the boat and approached me. I swear, I thought it was death coming for me. Turns out it was a Navy Seal Corpsman who was in a zodiac boat nearby. He heard it over the radio and came to render assistance. 


Between the Corpsman and the doctor they put the torn chunks of flesh back in place and got me into a Stokes Stretcher. The one with a life jacket at one end. Some how I ended up with my feet at the life jacket end. This became important to me later.


As they loaded me on to the very tank that crushed me, I saw all that blood on deck and knew my chances were not good. I remember leavin the boat and being put into a Shithook and whisked away as several Corpsman from the Aid Station jumped in.


As we were flying I was face down and could see out of the open door as we cruised over swampland. All I could think of was if this bird crashes, I am gong to float upside down and drown. That actually scared me. I tried my best to tell them but I could not talk. It was getting hard to breathe much less speak. 


They got me to the hospital quickly. Turns out the helo pilot flew Dustoff missions in Vietnam. His job then was Medical Evacuation. Buddies said he made that Chinook do things it was not supposed to do as he lifted off.


As they took me off the bird I saw even more blood. It did not take long to get more in me though. They radioed ahead and got the blood type from my dog tags. The only vein available in those seconds was on my neck. The doc stuck the needle in as we were rolling towards the ER. I felt that cold blood reach my heart and spread throughout my body. Weird feeling.


I stayed awake throughout the entire ordeal in the ER and pre-op. I thought that I was going to die, all that blood on the deck of my boat, on the helo, and now on the floor? I actually said, ""fuuuuuuuuuuuuck"" a few times.


I thought of my daughter. She was 13 months old and would never remember me. That was my last thought as they put me under. I did not expect to wake up.


Sometimes I do wake up and wonder if it was a dream. Then I move. Nope, not a dream. It still hurts.","736"
"38","I’ve met women going on and into their 30s who have never masturbated. It can be incredibly frustrating when you’re dating and you get to that point (sleeping together) and you start asking stuff like “so, what do you like? What gets you off?” And they’re like “I dunno.”

I’ve literally had women tell me “I don’t masturbate, that’s what guys are for.” And then wonder why they’ve never had an orgasm or rarely do when having sex. I’m like girl, figure yourself out. I’m happy to help you explore but damn.","737"
"39","YES! It’s so messed up, just from a biological stand point. Dogs will hump a pillow like mad when they’re horny, dolphins turn dead fish into fleshlights (you’re welcome, those of you who didn’t know this and didn’t need to know it!), monkeys and apes masturbate just because they’re bored, but somehow we “the smartest species” have somewhere around—if I’m remembering correctly—36% of the population who’ve just never masturbated.

That’s roughly a third of living humans who have just never gotten to know their own sexuality. No wonder we’ve got so many hang ups around sex, a third of us aren’t even comfortable enough with it to engage in a solo mission!

Feel like I’m channeling my old psych of sex professor here, he spent an entire 3 hour lecture once basically just telling us all “fucking masturbate, damn you, you’ll be physically, emotionally, and mentally healthier!”","741"
"40","I think you nailed it already, we have more stringent controls today. That, and we don't have quite so flippant an approach to psychological health.  In the 80s--hell, all the way up until the 2010s and even to some extent today--a lot of people viewed psychology as a pseudo-science instead of a genuine aspect of human health. We also didn't understand the importance of sexual health as it pertains to human physical and emotional well-being. 

The studies done by Masters and Johnson in the 60s had barely begun to percolate into the comprehension of their own professional field. It hadn't even broken through the shield wall of popular cultural understanding yet. 

Additionally, as mentioned in another string of replies to this first post, we are *incredibly* hung up on sexuality in most countries with a strong religious element. American and Middle-eastern countries are especially impacted by it. We can't discuss sex in a healthy way. We struggle to even consider the importance of sexual satisfaction in our romantic lives, much less our day-to-day lives. This would impact any study, from the 80s or today.  Some of those guys who said they do masturbate regularly likely don't. Some of the ones who said they don't almost certainly do.  We get real squirmy and insecure talking about our sexual health.

It's still a struggling area of cultural growth today. Just look at the hollywood film industry.  A film had a man's head explode on screen?  ""Ah, that's not a big deal, that stuffs not real!"" A woman shows her nipples, or a man hangs dong on screen? ""RATED R, VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED! Oh god, won't someone PLEASE think of the children?!"" 

Doctors and therapists are still struggling to help people comprehend the importance of it in our day to day lives, and regularly encouraging people to experiment for themselves just to see its impact on normal existence.

A great at home test my sex psych prof taught us: 

Think about a decision you're currently grappling with at this time. Maybe you're considering moving, changing jobs, asking a girl out, or just whether or not you want to go out to eat.  Think about how you feel right now, and then go masturbate to completion. 

Once you've climaxed, reconsider that big decision.  Do you still feel the same way about it? 

Masturbation releases a huge rush of hormones.  Guys often joke about ""Post nut clarity"" but it's a thing for women as well.  The reason we have that ""post nut clarity"" is that the rush of hormones helps our brains shift into higher gear and think more clearly.  You can make a decision with greater clarity and awareness after you've masturbated, and you'll most likely be able to *feel* just how much clearer your mind is at the time. 

My professor actively encouraged this for any major decision. Asking someone out, quitting your job, accepting a promotion, moving to a new house/city/state/country, whatever. Any major decision in your life he said masturbate before you make it if it is at all possible to do so, because you will make a better decision when you've had that rush of chemicals through your brain to help heighten awareness.

A lot of people have never been taught the importance of their sexual health. And when they're confronted with that, or asked to talk about it, they'd sooner lie than be open and honest. It's too uncomfortable a topic for them to discuss casually, and that in itself is a problem.  Sexual health is tied to both mental and physical health. We need to be as comfortable talking about it as we are talking about PTSD, prostate exams, suicide, or breast cancer awareness.","794"

"46","If anyone is wondering if the OP is *really* a military story, I vote ""Yea."" I think it's about the difference between a horde and an Army, between Gestapo-in-uniform and a German soldier.

I served in the US Army, and that difference emerges at surprising times. Here's an excerpt from [Wolf](https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/hl2svy/wolf_repost/), starring Wolf himself. Vietnam 1968, village patrol by an armored cav troop in the villages and dunes along the South China Sea:

&gt;Picture this scene then: A hot, bright day on the low conifers that top the dunes. We’ve just rolled in. No resistance, but the villagers have been careless - there were medical packs dropped here and there. Someone had been here recently. The Ruff-Puffs (South Vietnamese intelligence people) were talking harshly to the resident old man.  
&gt;  
&gt;I was plotting fire and getting lunch. Across the white sand stomped Sergeant Wolf. He was hauling a boy, about 10, by one arm. The boy was screaming in protest and dragging his feet. Wolf looked pissed off. He was wearing his helmet, fatigue pants with a pistol. He had no shirt - a totally white, hairy guy about twice the size of Vietnamese male. The kid’s other arm was being held by his mother (or grandmother - hard to tell) who was also being dragged along, even with both her feet planted in the sand. She was screaming too. Behind her, half running, was another old man, pleading the boy’s case in rapid Vietnamese. This procession was headed straight for the Ruff-Puff track.  
&gt;  
&gt;I was eating C rations. Dinner and a show! I picked up my food and joined the parade.  
&gt;  
&gt;When grandpa-san and momma-san caught sight of the Ruff-Puff track the wailing and crying and pleading doubled in volume, but Wolf was relentless. He dragged them on.  
&gt;  
&gt;He dragged them right past the Ruff-Puff track and over to the medical track. He stopped there, turned around, broke Momma’s grip on the boy’s other arm, lifted the boy up, sat him down in the track, lifted the kid's leg in front of our medic’s nose, and pointed to an infected, infested pus blossom on the boy's leg. “Lance that,” he said. “Clean it up.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Then he glared at momma-san and grandpa-san who were staring at the red-cross on the medic’s bag getting a clue. As soon as he saw they understood what was going on, he turned and stomped over to his track without another word.  
&gt;  
&gt;One of his track crew gave him a look. “Fuck,” said Wolf. “I got kids. You need to take care of that shit. Can’t just let it fester.”  
&gt;  
&gt;No one said anything. We were all kind of astonished. I don’t know about anyone else, but I was having difficulty imagining Sergeant Wolf with a kid. Wasn’t possible, was it? Damn.  
&gt;  
&gt;But y’know, that was the most sane thing I saw that day. Good to see...

I think it's a far reach, but at some level, this is the *same* thing OP is talking about. A *real* soldier has a duty to protect and assist the citizens of his country - and the citizens of any country he is assisting - and even enemy soldiers who are *hors de combat*. I swear, our POWs were only in danger of getting swarmed by our medics or choking to death on cigarettes.

I submit that the OP is not only a military story, it's a *good* military story.","926"

Gotta love going from having 6-10 inches of snow with temps hitting -10 (w/o wind chill) to upper 50’s and sunny in less than 2 weeks during December/January or being stuck at home thanks to the April/May blizzard that dumps over a foot of snow in just a few hours.","931"
"49","I joined the Navy at the age 20 , and my first post after boot camp, and school was a base in the middle of no where base in Japan.  I arrived at the International Airport in Narita, first time out of the US, and way more nervous then I would ever admit. There was no one to meet me, but I remembered to look for the USO. I found the USO and called the base, and was told to get on the bus to Camp Zama Army Base and some one would meet me there.

By the time I got to Zama, I had been traveling for over 20 hours. All I wanted was a shower and sleep, but there was no one there to meet me.

Fun fact - the bus from the airport dropped passengers at the enlisted club.

So now I am at the club, with two seabags and a backpack, on a Saturday night. I found a phone and called the base again and was told someone would be there in an hour or so. The only place to sit where I could see the front door was in the main lobby. I desperately need food, a shower, and sleep but am stuck being on display in the main lobby. I can hear the music, smell food, but there is no way I can navigate this with all of my belongings. 3 guys (all were POC) walk in and look at me and chuckle as they walk by me. I just want to disappear. A few minutes later they come back, and offer to watch my stuff if I want to go grab food or something to drink.  I looked at them for a minute, my brain was arguing with my stomach. You can't leave your stuff with 3 guys you have never seen before. I thanked them but turned them down.  I could still hear the warnings my parents had given me about being a small in stature woman and dealing with a group of men I don't know echoing in my head.

One of the three gave me a sad smile and they walked away. About 15 minutes later they were back with a waitress, she was carrying several plates of burgers, fries and drinks. The one who smiled at me said that he got me some food and had the waitress bring it to let me know it was ok.   The three of them sat on the floor next to me and introduced themself. Brian was the one who smiled at me and his friends were John and Tony. They asked me where I was going, and I told them and they smiled and said that they were Marines working as part of a security force. I told them that I was a cryptographer and Japan was my first duty station. We talked about lots of things but I honestly don't remember what anymore. I just remember it as a friendly happy conversation. Several times their friends came out of the dance club and called for them to get in there, and each time they declined. They sat with me for at least 90 mins until the duty van showed up to get me. They insisted on carrying my things to the van and refused to allow me to pay for the food they got me.

I told the driver I wanted to use the bathroom and would be right back. I turned back towards the club and they were gone. I never even got to thank them, I was sad that I did not really know anything about them and would probably never see them again.  It was after midnight by the time I checked in and got assigned a barracks room.

The next morning, I went to get breakfast and while I was standing in line. Someone tapped me on the shoulder, I turned around and there they were (Brian, John and Tony) grinning from ear to ear. I was so happy to see them, it felt like they were old friends. We sat together after we got our food, and Brian told me, we were going to offer to drive you over here last night but we did not think you would accept. I honestly said that I probably wouldn't have.

Several years later, I asked Brian why they offered to help some scrawny white girl they had never seen before. Brian looked at me and said

***""The color of skin doesn't matter we all bleed the same...Red, White, and Blue""***

Brian, Tony and John taught me a very valuable lesson that day that I have tried to live by.

I am proud to say that I remained friends with all three. Tony was KIA in Afghanistan, and John in a car accident 2013. I am writing this today while sitting in an airport bar in Atlanta. This and a thousand other stories run on a loop in my brain. I am trying to figure out what I am going to say to Brian's wife and kids as I stand with them to say goodbye to one of the best friend I have ever had.

FUCK CANCER

I invite you all to raise a drink tonight to the men and women who bleed red, white and blue.

Semper Fidelis my friend.

**UPDATE - Thank you all for your kind words, I made my flight although I had to be screened to determine if I was too drunk to fly. Apparently being emotional after one drink is a no-no on Delta. They also did not appreciate my telling them that I had not planned to fly the plane but could give it a go if they really needed me to.**

**I thought you would all appreciate what happened next. My flight lands and I head for the rental car desk. I am on the escalator and I hear people ahead of me laughing and I look over the heads of the people in front of me when I see it.  Tre (Brian's older brother) is standing to the right at the bottom of the stairs holding a sign (like you see limo drivers holding) that reads...**

**""Token White Girl""**

**I burst into hysterical laughter, and Tre sees me and starts laughing. We both go from laughter to tears. I get off the escalator and give him a hug. We are both nearly hysterical with tears streaming down our faces, and we can barely stay upright. Which led to the police coming over to ask if I am ok...Which just set us off laughing again. It took about 10 minutes for Tre and I to calm down enough to explain to the cops we are fine, and head for his car. We sat in the car for another 20 minutes laughing, knowing that Brian would have been ROFL watching that.**","935"

"51","Damn, this story just hits home! When my brother was graduating from BCT at Fort Sill, my family went down there for graduation. The day before being family day, we got to sit outside their barracks as they gave some speeches and demonstrated some of what they learned. After it was all said and done, there was one final event which ended up being a naturalization ceremony. There was 7-8 soldiers from his company who all became American citizens that day! Getting to hear where they were from and the fact that they as non-citizens, still enlisted knowing we were in the middle of 2 wars, but felt it was important enough to still do so. Getting to witness it, and seeing their smiles/happiness made me shed a couple tears. Definitely a top, ""we all bleed the same...red, white and blue"" moment for me!","1059"

I'm starting to realize I have quite a lot of stories, might have to change how I link them.

*I’m French. I’m in the Army. I’m in the infantry and fucking proud of it. I do love embracing the suck and I always took everything with that « fuck it » mindset.*

An endless patrol, endless day with my legs aching because I stand up in my turret, the sun is warming my head under my helmet. My ballistic glasses are doing a bad job at stopping the sun's rays, my fingers are sweaty and riddled because of it. I'm perfecting the gunner's tan : V shaped on my chest, neck and forearms. I don't know if I'm tan or just dirty. Probably the latest.

For some reasons I'm rarely first in the column so I can pick up the dust from the vehicles in front of me. I see turrets turning sometimes and I turn mine accordingly, sometimes I scan left, sometimes right. I'm carefully watching a desert with dark rocks, orange dust. I am not so far from Matt Damon's potato salad.

I feel a push on my leg, it's my buddy giving me a bottle of water. Great, warm plastic tasting water. I drink it and I miss my mouth half the time because of the uneven dirt road. I hear my buddies singing loudly a French Army song, it's ""*La Mort*"". They don't sing it correctly but they do what they can with the engine blasting inside. I sing with them in the wind. Brotherhood.

We are heading back to the FOB. I sigh with relief. Finally.

I am glad we are heading back so I can finally sit and clean up a bit. I am happy we are heading back because we are passing in a village we are used to go through.

More dust, more sun, more scanning, more songs.

Every soldier who deployed know that you find happiness in the small things. The small habits you have, become your little happy place.

You see, in that village, nobody really like us. We have the more than occasional ""Go back home !"", ""French colonialists !"", ""Rapists ! Pigs !"". Nothing really dangerous but it will wear you out month after month. The boys in the vehicle don't really experience it but us, gunners, deal with it directly. Head outside, you look at them right in the eyes. You shouldn't, yet, you defy them.

Sometimes, things get tricky and you're the one stopping any outside elements hurting your buddies. You have probably see the video of the US Soldier in Iraq pulling its sidearm to stop a car to get close. I have to settle this now. Yes, some countries consider a sidearm way more serious than a M240 with a 200 rounds belt. Sidearms are for executions. It's a honor thing.

I've seen a lot of gunners pulling their Glock 17 and I had to do it a few times. Fun times I guess.

Anyway, this village. My small happy moment during patrol.

We go by small wooden and dirt houses. They are more like small cabins. There's a lot of goats, some donkeys, a few dogs. One of the houses hosted an old lady. A lady that had so many wrinkles on her face. Wrinkles coming from a hard labor life under the unforgiving sun. She was so thin.

In my thoughts I called her grandma.

Grandma used to sit on a small log next to a dirt wall. Sitting in the small shadow cast by the wall. She was there in traditional clothing, a bright red with yellow and blue strips. She was the only one that smiled to us, to me. She waved her thin arms to say hello.

I was in my armored turret with my M240. A guy fully covered that just nodded and waved his left hand, right hand on his gun. She was looking through me. Yet, she smiled at me, every damn time.

I guessed she was used to war and seeing soldiers from every corner of the world going through her village. I was just one more but she took time to salute us.

A grandma on a small piece of wood, in the shadow.

Every patrol I waited for her. Every time she was here. Same clothes, same place, same smile, same wave of the arms.

I did dozens, if not more, of patrols and she was always here. My small happiness during patrol. A smile in a world of danger and anger.

Today. I remember this day. I remember this patrol. I remember the way back to the FOB. I remember the village and the hate looks we got.

We go by the small wooden and dirt houses. I see the small piece of wood. No bright red dress. No wrinkles. No smile. No wave.

I never saw her again.

Grandma, wherever you are, there's a young man thinking about you. Grandma, I hope you are doing okay no matter what happened to you.","1087"

Every family has their secrets, and ours was that Yia Yia was a bit crazy. One could point to her sudden and animated outbursts of anger in awkward places. Her decades of pill popping that made her loopy and fall over. There was her seemingly random religious proclamations. Her lifelong gambling obsession. Her propensity to nick items from stores without paying for them, and sometimes getting caught.

It became the inside joke of our family. Whenever a new incident happened and the word of it spread amongst our family, there was an ashamed amusement over it. A laugh and sort of exasperated “That’s Yia Yia.” It could reach boiling points sometimes. Like when we would receive calls from the police because she was acting irate in a store or cursing at family members because they disagreed with her assertion of events.

In my high school history class, I had to do an assignment which I have gathered that just about American schoolkid must do at one time or another: you interview a relative about their life. The idea is to glean what it was like to be alive during historical events we all live through. I decided to interview Yia Yia.

I had always known she grew up in Greece. I had known she lived there through the Second World War. I knew she came to America by way of meeting and marrying my grandfather, an American GI in Europe. 

This assignment brought new aspects of her life to light. She recalled being in a field and watching German and Bulgarian soldiers march into her town. She recalled seeing her neighbor executed in the street by Bulgarian soldiers. She told me about watching her mother eat sawdust and breadcrumbs mixed with vinegar during the Greek famine, and Jewish neighbors disappearing. She recalled hurrying home one night during the war, as she was out past the curfew, and being stopped by Bulgarian soldiers at a checkpoint. She relayed how they threatened her life, and she was only saved because a passing German officer put a stop to what these Bulgarians were doing, believe it or not. It took me decades to realize and wonder if there was more to that specific story, that she didn’t say. In the context of a war in which literally millions of women were violently raped by soldiers of armies traversing and occupying their towns.

Not all of her stories were of her being a victim, however. Some were defiant, maybe even heroic. She told me about how she beat up the wife of the commanding Bulgarian General in charge of the occupation of her town and had to hide for days as soldiers searched for her. She told me about being rounded up with other women in her town, being put onto trucks and driven into the mountains. She survived to tell me the story by jumping out of the truck while it was driving and hiding in the mountains for a period of time.

Yia Yia was born in 1923. Greece was invaded in 1941. She endured these catastrophic events as she was coming into womanhood. More forgotten to those outside of Greece, however, was that Greece also had a brutal civil war that began when the Axis occupation ended and didn’t end until 1949. It is often considered the first proxy war of the Cold War. Yia Yia really had her youth robbed by the brutality of war. 

My own experience with war came when I was 20. I was sent to Afghanistan as an infantryman and saw war through that lense. I had to fight for my life on numerous occasions. I had close brushes with death. I watched an 18-year-old friend take his last breath with his head in my lap, as we sat in a field. I put two other friends into their body bags, as well. I saw civilians caught in the middle of it all. Many stories too intimate, still too fresh to tell, even to those I am closest to. Of course, I have also lost many friends to suicide, since.

If surviving war was one journey, “coming home” Is another. “Coming home” is really the journey of recovery from it. It is a process, not an event. For many, it can be a journey that never ends. A decade plus removed from my service overseas, I’ve been better able to put much in perspective. I’ve started to realize the similarities between Yia Yia and me. Replace pills with various other substances, especially marijuana. Searching for spirituality in different places. The violent and random outbursts of anger that terrified family members. 

This is how we “carry it.” The trauma, the guilt, the frustration. It isn’t pretty or neat or easy to explain. How can one even begin to explain it all? Especially to those who have no concept of what it is like to live through something like war. 

Yia Yia passed away in 2015. I didn’t realize most of what I just said until after she passed away. I am not sure how I could have used this knowledge while she was alive. I do think I could have been more patient with her. Maybe I could have listened to her more about her life, about what she saw? I think these, because it’s what I often wish for, for those around me. I feel a camaraderie with Yia Yia now. An understanding. In a way it now feels, how we spoke about her, is how we speak about me. How she acted was inexplicable to many in our family. But I get it, Yia Yia.","1091"

"58","We had one girl in my flight in basic that had been lied HARD to by the recruiter.  She was a class III recruit back when the Air Force seldom took them.  She was great and would have been exceptional in the career field she wanted, which was heavy equipment maintenance.  She had been helping her dad and brothers her entire life, working in her dad's maintenance company.  Her entire life's dream had been to join the Air Force.

She failed high school, but with really hard work had passed her GED.  I don't know how she passed her ASVAB, unless the recruiter somehow did it for her.   She worked really hard and she was put in remedial classes to try and bring her up to speed.  She tried so, so hard and the whole flight tried to help with tutoring, explaining things and quizzing her, but there was no way.  She had been failed by her entire school experience and not given the tools to help her succeed.

Finally, they moved her over to the casual squadron until her paperwork for discharge could be finalized.  I was the only one that she got to say goodbye to as I was pulling dorm guard while the rest of the flight was doing the confidence course (hard to do with a full leg cast on).  Absolutely broke my heart.  She gave me a big hug and said her dad was glad she was coming home and she'd be working for him again.  Said to tell everyone goodbye and thank you for trying so hard for her.  I managed to hold on until the door closed on her and my TI before I lost it and ugly cried for a good 15 minutes.

I was in boot camp in San Diego, so no female recruits. I think at the time they were all in Florida. I was also the company Recruit Yeoman and the only Recruit Petty Officer to keep his position for all of boot camp. 

No bunk room off the Company Commander’s office, but he did have a private head which I was responsible for cleaning, so after a week or so, he told me I could use it, since I was cleaning it.

It was good for some private ‘me time.’

Our CC was ‘pushing’ his first company, so we worked pretty hard to do well. He gave me a fair amount of leeway and early on, after some in barracks issues, he told the company that in barracks, when he wasn’t in, I was in charge. Had a few interesting moments, one time with a guy who had a buddy mail some weed to him.

The CC came in one night just before lights-out, very drunk, and told me, a buddy of mine and another guy to meet him in the office. We had a rambling and far reaching discussion where he told us a number of sea stories and learned more about us. He drunkenly lit a cigarette, filter first before I could stop him. It was his last, so I got my pack and he told us we could all smoke. 

He had a big boom box on this desk that he used to play his favorite music (country and pop rock). He took a head call and when he did I put a blank tape in the machine and hit record. To capture the memories as it were…

He told us about his fear doing a shore bombardment during the Vietnam war, in the after 5 inch mount, and about “Herbie,” a chameleon (lizard) that he found near his bunk on the ship and adopted, giving it water and food and how one day, returning to his bunk, he found Herbie dead. At that point in the he started crying.

The next day he came in late, bleary eyed and complaining of a headache. He called me aside and asked if he had done anything bad the night before and I told him, truthfully, that he had not. But a few minutes later I heard him scream “Yeoman! Get your ass in here!”

He had noticed the blank tape - the Chicago cassette sitting in the box - and played it back. He was red in the face saying it could get us all in trouble, since we were up late and smoking etc. 

He could not figure out how to erase the tape so he made that my job. I thought I was really in trouble but as I hit ‘Record’ I said “I’m sorry about Herbie” and he started laughing and called me a few names and that was that.","1376"

I swear I did not have this pun in mind when I originally chose Squirrel's pseudonym.

Those of you that read the last entry in the Chronicles of Squirrel remember (or have been unable to forget) that he graduated Basic Combat Training. This post is a collection of subsequent events that will serve as a sort of de-briefing on this matter (us intel weenies love our de-briefings-- *WAIT NO*). All these events occurred at Fort Huachuca during the Intelligence Analyst course. That's right, Squirrel went to intel school.

I guess being in an air-conditioned classroom with NCOs whose primary method of communication wasn't shouting fooled Squirrel into believing he was back in high school, because the stupid just poured from his mouth. 

One day, one instructor was recounting a dismounted patrol in urban Iraq and detailed how she'd bought hard knuckle gloves specifically for when the locals got a little too friendly. The discussion naturally steered toward use of force, and Squirrel asked, ""What if they spit on me, can I shoot them then? 'Cause what if they have AIDS?""

We were going over biases another day and discussing how to stay objective and not make presumptions, and Squirrel felt the need to let the entire class know, ""Oh, yeah I do that. I judge people on what music they listen to, what they wear,"" at which point another trainee helpfully interjected, ""We all dress the same here, Squirrel,"" and another added ""Well, one of us is gonna have to change.""

Another day we were on break, and Squirrel was lucky for that fact because if an instructor had heard this fall out of his mouth, he'd have had an immediate and uncomfortable reminder that he was, in fact, still in the Army. He said, ""You know, I joined because I wanted to help people. I'd rather hug someone than shoot them."" I gently told him, ""If I see you in a firefight walking toward the enemy trying to hug them, I'm shooting you in the back, there's no fucking way you'll hold up to torture.""

The schoolwork also revealed plenty about Squirrel that those who spent BCT with him already knew. I went through when Reading, Writing, and Briefing was still a separate module from IPB1. It barely even stood on its own as a module, so I can see why they folded it in, but it did serve the purpose of very quickly identifying trainees that had been left partially lobotomized by basic training or had never had much going on upstairs in the first place. Having had a public school education, I was capable of making a powerpoint using source information, and I had just conveniently learned *alllll* about classification markings and how to use them. I had learned, Squirrel hadn't.

Now, as you all have read beforehand, Squirrel never learned to make his bed. Squirrel never learned to order his locker according to SOP (which in order to do so you literally only need to follow a list). It came as no surprise to me that Squirrel did not realize that he was supposed to apply what he had been taught in the past week or two when producing a powerpoint for the RWB Graded Practical Exercise (because calling it a test or exam is *too stressful*). Our instructor, having not the benefit of reading my primer on Squirrel due to it having been written several years ex-post-facto, was surprised when Squirrel's powerpoint was turned in without classification markings. I'll add that we were working in a real SCIF using real SCI as sources.

Squirrel had ""tapped"" the GPE, which meant he got retrained and had to re-submit his brief slides. Tapping is no big deal, I tapped IPB2 myself when I went way overboard restricting terrain on the map and then didn't have time to finish the typework. When you tap an IPB, you have to retest, which is a whole other can of worms. If you tap RWB, however, all you need to do is correct your slides or re-do your brief depending on which you failed. Admittedly, the smartest thing Squirrel ever did was tap RWB instead of one of the IPBs. He submitted his corrected slides later that day. The instructor noticed something odd about the slides and asked Squirrel if he was sure he submitted the right file. Squirrel said yes. The instructor again asked if he was sure, Squirrel said yes again with what I imagine was the same wrongfully self-assured look he had when he told me he was not wearing my beret. Our instructor asked him one more time, this time he really stressed the word ""sure"" in a tone that would make anyone with two brain cells to rub together consider that maybe they should actually check and see if they'd submitted the right file. Squirrel, unfortunately, did not meet the above prerequisite and simply said yes again. And that was how Squirrel double-tapped RWB and got recycled: by submitting the exact same document that had already received a failing score and not bothering to check what he submitted when prompted.

When he left, he took the set of wet erase markers from his desk. I don't know why, he didn't take the stencil or anything else. Maybe he just liked the pretty colors? Or maybe he just couldn't say goodbye without causing us one more problem. Shortly after he left we got a recycle in our class to take his place. And his markers. It took us weeks to get the markers back from the other class, while our recycle had to borrow from the trainees next to him. When the other class's instructor brought them back, they were missing their case. Our own instructor inquired as to where the case was, and was told in reply, ""I dunno, maybe he got hungry.""

When I left Fort Huachuca I thought I'd never hear the name ""Squirrel"" again save in my nightmares. One sunny day at Fort Campbell I was recounting one of the many exploits I've shared with you to a fellow PFC when a newly-arrived analyst overheard me using the name ""Squirrel."" I shit you not, this guy was in the class they recycled Squirrel into, and it gets worse from there.

Now, I know this sub has a rule against stories from other service members, but this service member was an *Allsource Intelligence Analyst* and our creed says ""For in truth lies victory!"" so we never, *ever,* lie. It's true. We have a chip implanted at the base of our spines with a built-in polygraph that delivers an electric shock the first time it detects a rhythm that indicates dishonesty, and the second time it releases a lethal dose of fentanyl, so I know he was telling the truth when he told me this next part. Anyway, he told me that Squirrel did not improve over time. In fact, he informed me that Squirrel had actually *cried* while trying to give a brief, apparently because the instructor couldn't keep himself from laughing at how bad he was at briefing. That's not the worst part, and unless you want to be overcome with a sense of dread and hopelessness (marginally more so than usual), I recommend that you stop reading here.

&gt;!Squirrel proceeded to graduate intelligence school and PCS'd to Fort Hood.!&lt;

I've now exhausted my entire knowledge base on Squirrel. In the future, some repressed memories involving him may come unraveled, and if so, I will share them with you after recovering from the subsequent psychological breakdown. My time in the service was short, and as a result I don't have many stories to share, so thank you for following me through this account so that these events and the trauma of those that suffered through them will not be forgotten or lost to time.

I offer you this wisdom, perhaps the only thing of value I got out of this experience:

 *I’m French. I’m in the Army. I’m in the infantry and fucking proud of it. I do love embracing the suck and I always took everything with that « fuck it » mindset.*

No need to think about all that. We are home. I am home. 

Sitting on my couch while looking at the moving images on my TV. I don't even see or hear what is playing at the moment. My fiancé is at work and she will be back at the end of the day. 

All day the TV is playing. I cannot stand the silence. The silence is loud. If there's no noise I feel the walls closing on me, I feel my thoughts creeping up to me, lurking at the edge of my vision. 

Silence brings me back to empty villages and endless stressful patrols. The silence just before and after a firefight. Will it be a lasting silence or shit is going down once again ? The silence that a mortar shell blast brings when it hit at night when you can't protect your ears. Firefights are easy, the silence between them is where psychological warfare starts. 

Silence is the noise of you thinking.

Don't get me wrong, I am happy to be home. Really happy. Although, my mind is playing tricks on me and it is like my own body wants me to hurt. He wants me to remember the adrenaline rushes, the fear that grows from deep inside your belly. 

I often catch myself replaying firefights and my hands get sweaty and my fists clench without me knowing. I am not really here, I am back. I hold my breath and catch myself lacking oxygen and take a deep breath and I'm back home. 

My cat walks up to me and just rest his head next to me and I know I'm alright. This little ball of fur helped my fiancé go through deployments and I am glad he was there. I am glad he's here now because it's like he can sense when I need him.

Most of my friends are here. We organized a party because we moved to a new flat and it's the perfect opportunity to celebrate me getting back and the new place. 

Music is in the background, food is spread out on our living room table and beers, wine, whisky is in everyone hands. It is great to see them all and hear them talk. They are all here and laughing and I look around quietly and take it all in. This is the life I want. 

I want my friends, my future wife around me all the time. That is my comfort zone and I feel good with them. Whisky is warming my throat and dulling my senses. 

I don't know what triggers it. I can't understand how it works. I am back there and still at home. I see my friends but I have other images floating in front of my eyes. They continue to talk, laugh and eat unaware of what I'm experiencing. 

I think the oven door slammed shut and it brought me over there. My fists clench and I just sit on the couch without moving. I'm not talking, trying to fight back the rush of emotions. 

I remember the blasts of rockets against hesco walls. Somebody laugh while clapping hands and I can remember the crack of 7.62 bullets above my head. My ears are sensitive because of all the time I didn't had time to put my Peltor before firing my gun. My hand automatically goes on the right side of my waist looking for my sidearm. I realize what I did and I act like I'm just settling my shirt. 

We are all getting a bit drunk and my friends are more eager to ask me questions about the deployment. They know that I wouldn't tell them if I wasn't comfortable enough and I guess I am. 

I tell them about the funny stories I witnessed or heard from the local army doing dumb shit. How funny and weird it can be to live with 45 dudes in a small FOB far from everything. I tell them all the stories they want to hear. I laugh with them and I am happy that they can understand some of it. 

They ask me about danger and if there was some real-deal that went down over there. I say yes with an awkward smile. I feel they want to hear more but do not dare ask too much, afraid of being out of bonds. I respect them a lot for that and this is why I feel like I need to tell them a bit about how it was. 

I just tell them, while avoiding eye contact, how a rocket sounds, the crack of bullets and how you get tunnel vision in a firefight. I explain to them how tracers looks at night. How seeing a convoy of motorbikes with ISIS flags in the distance can bring hatred in your heart. How it feels to being shot at and understand it was near. 

I quickly switch to some funny moments where I ate dirt because I trip on my ammo belt. 

I am afraid to say too much or something that might make them judge me. Yet, I can't stop talking because I'm afraid that the silence will come back or that I'll be stuck with the memories. 

Party is over and everybody is sleeping. 

I lay in my bed, fiancé besides me. The room spin a bit and I think about everything. How did I went from constant deployment life to being in my own bed after a party. I should feel safe but something deep inside me stops me from sleeping. 

I'm not scared of what can happen anymore. I am scared that if I don't put in the work, I'll be traumatized for the rest of my life. 

That night, I decided to start writing. I owe it to me, I owe it to everyone around me. 

I don't fear the silence anymore.","1547"
"65","In 1992, I was attending Army AIT at Fort Benning, Georgia.  Halfway through my training cycle, I had to pull detail as CQ (Charge of Quarters) Runner.  Being the CQ Runner sucked.  You (the Runner) and the CQ (a Drill Sergeant) sat at a desk in the Company's main office, monitoring the phones, and responding if any of the soldiers in the Company did anything stupid.

During my CQ Runner shift, I was stuck with Drill Sergeant Griffith (not real name).  DS Griffith was both a married man with multiple children, and a ladies' man with multiple booty calls that he liked to brag about.

An hour into my shift at the CQ Runner's desk, fighting boredom by reading the incredibly boring Soldier's Guide, while DS Griffith is on the phone in the next room talking to some woman that he obviously intended to bang.

DS Griffith hangs up the phone, walks up to me and tells me, ""you monitor the phone.  I need to head out to the shopette.""  It was obvious that DS Griffith was on his way to meet the woman on the phone and get laid, or 'get some guts' as he used to say.

Ten minutes after DS Griffith left the CP, I received a call from a woman claiming to be DS Griffith's wife.  I told the woman that I didn't know where DS Griffith was, but I would DS Griffith know that she called.  The woman began calling every five minutes for the next two hours, each call more frantic, with more crying, and more desperate than the last.

After more than a dozen calls, I decided to lie to DS Griffith's wife.  I told her that there was a fight between a couple of soldiers in the barracks, and one of the soldiers had broken some teeth.  DS Griffith had taken the kid with the broken teeth to the Emergency Room.  The woman was relieved, thanked me, and didn't call back.

Thirty minutes after the last call from his wife, DS Griffith returned from his trip to Bootyville.  I told DS Griffith that his wife had been calling non-stop.  DS Griffith looked like he had shit himself.  ""What did you tell my wife, Private?""  I told DS Griffith the lie that I had told his wife.  DS Griffith ran into the next room and called his wife.  I heard him say, ""yeah, these two sorry-ass knuckleheads got into a scrap, and I had to take one of them to the ER.  Sorry I didn't call you.""

DS Griffith hung up with his wife, walked up to me and said, ""I'll be right back, man.  I mean it this time.""  A half hour later, DS Griffith returned with a large pepperoni pizza and a six-pack of Miller Genuine Draft.  We sat there, ate pizza, drank beer, and watched a VHS tape of ComicView on BET.

DS Griffith told me, ""what you did tonight is what being a good soldier is all about.""","1555"
"66","It's not all me - support is a group event. I was actually involuntarily in-patient in a VA Psychiatric Ward after spending ten years discounting the effects my own PTSD as me just being foolish.

And there I learned that the best kind of therapy is group therapy. We didn't get lectures from Psychiatrists, but we lectured each other, had little patience for evasion and rationalization, swapped coping mechanisms. We learned to monitor each other, and through that concern for each other, we learned how to monitor ourselves.

This subreddit works much the same way. Writing here leaves you open to suggestions from folks who have traveled the same path, validation that none of what you're feeling is ridiculous and absurd and you should just get over it. I don't know if you've told yourself that. Hope not. I sure did.

I have no qualifications to be some kind of expert - I read and sometimes detect things that, if they were in my vicinity, would indicate that I need to pay attention.

"69","I was in Iraq a while back. I tried to make a habit of sending email updates to family and friends. What follows below is one of those emails that I sent home. It was originally written to that audience of civilians so you may see some extra explanatory detail about something that seems obvious to you military readers.

**All** names changed, etc.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

Hi all,

Sorry my update's a little late, but I've just been swamped. I promise I'll send a regular update shortly. What I want to do today, though, is to offer a small snapshot of the nature of this war:

I took a short flight last night on a Blackhawk helicopter, traveling with the Brigade commander and some other staff officers from Camp Banger to FOB Boomer (FOB = Forward Operating Base). I needed to get some documents signed by the Division Commander (2-star/Major General Jack), and I happened to know where he was going to be in about an hour.

It was after dark when we got picked up - the helos dropped in at our LZ (Landing Zone) and the crew signalled us with flashlights to let us know we could approach and board. We lifted off into the dark night, headed south. I could see the lights of Baghdad below - some electric, many fires, but there were no lights for us - just the shadowy outlines of my brothers in the Blackhawk. Someone would occasionally turn his head to look out the window and I'd know it by the sudden appearance of the cat-eyes glowing on the back of his helmet. There was little talking - it's too noisy, and shouting gets old quickly. Besides, your shouts only carry well to the guy next to you.

We dropped onto Boomer LZ after about a ten-minute flight, where we were expected and picked up by soldiers with Gators who took us to the Headquarters building. We dropped magazines from our weapons and cleared them on the way, and then dropped our helmets and flak vests along the wall inside.

We all noticed, but did not dwell on, the memorial set up in the FOB Boomer assembly hall. Boots, medals in a case, rifle on-end with a helmet on top, dog tags dangling off the pistol grip, a picture of the fallen soldier. We were here for a memorial service - the Brigade had sustained our first combat casualty of the deployment. ""Sustained a casualty"" sounds so sterile and unfeeling, I know, but that's the Army for you - cold and impersonal. We're all business, don't you know.

As we waited for the service to begin, many of us took the time to catch up with seldom-seen faces. It's nice to have a few minutes when you simply *will not* be doing anything else, and crass or not, we took advantage of the grim opportunity to connect outside of the usual run of missions, meetings, briefings, etc., while at the same time avoiding talking about the fallen soldier. But that's the Army for you - cold and impersonal. You just never know when you'll run into Sergeant Jones again, especially in a war zone.

Eventually, the Company was formed up and stood there in front of the memorial, waiting. But . . . waiting for what? The distinguished guest, of course. Major General (MG) Jack hadn't arrived yet, and they couldn't start the service without him. He wasn't anything to the fallen soldier, but generals exist in a semi-political space so he was coming to lend the weight of his office to the event, and to offer his meaningless condolences. Everybody that mattered, anyone who really knew and cared about the fallen soldier, was already there, but they had to wait on someone who likely viewed the event as an unwanted hiccup in his busy schedule. Just one more example of the bureaucracy we deal with every day, even around a memorial service. But again, that's the Army for you - cold and impersonal. Even in death we have to keep up appearances.

Once the General arrived and the service began, I noted the precision of the procession of speakers. MG Jack and the unit commanders first, followed by the close friends offering remembrances. Then there was the Chaplain providing guidance and words of hope for the living. All of it was timed - the chain of command and friends each get four minutes, the Chaplain gets a little more. Like clockwork. Despite the emotional remembrances that made it obvious the fallen soldier was respected and well-liked, it was also obvious that we still had business to do and we were not going to linger unnecessarily. But that's the Army for you - cold and impersonal - and we've got precisely 42 minutes for grief.

I listened through it all, empathizing with my brothers in arms who had lost one so close to them, but I hadn't known the fallen soldier, hadn't even known *of* the soldier, until the fatal incident had been reported up to Brigade headquarters a few days earlier. I remained composed throughout. Like so many of my brothers and sisters, I too can be cold and impersonal. We are what the Army makes us.

At the end of the remembrances, the First Sergeant called the Company to attention and began a final symbolic roll call. ""Private Alex Durant!"" he called, and Private Durant promptly sounded off with a hearty ""Here, First Sergeant!""

""Specialist Allen Murphy!"" called the First Sergeant. Just like Durant, Specialist Murphy responded with a loud ""Here, First Sergeant"".

""Lieutenant Spencer!"" he called next, and received no response. I could feel the distance between me and the deceased rapidly closing, and unexpected tears welled up in my eyes. 

""Lieutenant Donna Spencer"" he called again, but again there was no response from Lieutenant Spencer.

""Second Lieutenant Donna. Allison. Spencer!"" he called for the last time, and silence rang out in response.

Lieutenant Spencer was not going to answer. I quietly wept for her, for her Army brothers and sisters, for her family back home - though I had not known her. She was one of us - one of the few who stepped up when almost nobody else will - and she was gone. I wept then for one I had not known, and I'm just about in tears again as I write this. I suppose that's also the Army for you. Maybe not quite as cold as I'd thought.

There were three volleys of M16 fire, and the bugler sounded Taps. At the end of Taps, many of the soldiers of the Company lined up to pay their last respects, stepping up to the memorial and saluting, some dropping to one knee to offer a silent prayer, or to leave a token of remembrance in front of Lieutenant Spencer's boots. Among them came the biggest fellow in the Company, a bull of a man wearing Specialist rank. He paid his respects, and as he turned from the memorial I could see tears streaming down his face, his countenance filled with anguish over his fallen sister. And *that*, truly, is the Army for you.

Our Brigade's first combat loss is a testament to the nature of this war. We lost 2LT Donna Spencer, a bright, dedicated woman in her mid-twenties, to the same sort of IED that you hear about in the news. Here in Iraq, there are no front lines. There are no rear areas. When you arrive, you are stepping into rough country. Don't misunderstand - it's not all bad. But when it *is* bad, there is no discrimination.

Y'all take care, and I'll talk to you again soon.

ps:  If you're keeping track, I completely forgot to get the General's signature on those documents. Must've been distracted.","1739"
"70","This may shock you to read, but as a young enlisted man, I did not consistently make excellent life choices in my early 20s. 

At one point I found myself working as the night shift supervisor for the division on an aircraft carrier that handled waste disposal. I'm glad to say it was every bit as glamorous as it sounds. Fortunately, the Kinder Gentler Navy of the '00s had learned to protect the environment, and while we'd eagerly kick 55 gallon oil drums off the side (remember, if &lt;2% of the original contents remain, it's legally ""empty!"" Poke it with a fire axe and kick it off the elevator!), good ol' Uncle Sam was going to be sure the plastic was properly recycled!\*

\*(""Fun"" fact, most of the plastic waste you ""recycle"" nowadays ends up in the same place that ours did; the landfill. Plastics, aside from carefully cleaned and sorted numbers 1-3, aren't super recyclable, and it's often cheaper (and sometimes more environmentally friendly, FFS) to make new plastic from crude oil, than to jump through the organic chemistry hoops needed to turn Styrofoam back into something useful.)

The Navy melted (melts? FFS, I hope they've changed!) big bags of plastic trash down into giant plastic pucks, about 2.5 feet across. The machines that did it sucked; they were unreliable as all hell. It was a 1 or 2 foot wide cylinder with a locking lid, and a hydraulic ram on the bottom; you drop in a bag of plastic, lock the lid, and the lid, walls, and floor of the cylinder heat up to a couple hundred degrees Fahrenheit. Then the ram slowly comes up, over 30 minutes, and squishes the trash bag into a big inch or two thick puck of plastic. Problem was, the ship only had *just* enough machines to keep up, and half would break within the first month underway; then, Trash Mountain would begin to form.

Another problem? Sure, the ship had ""Clean Plastic"" trash cans. Rule was, only rinsed out, clean plastic was allowed, inside of clear plastic bags. No residue, no food waste, just clean virgin plastic.

Well, that was day shift's job to screen the waste. And sure, they processed *some.*

So, Trash Mountain would grow every morning, in both the Forward and Aft Plastic Waste Processing (PWP) rooms. Aft kept up\* (sidebar on this later; ""lazy"" Marines are awesome), but up Forward, the Mountain grew.

Remember that day shift ""screened"" the waste? All the plastic trash was in clear plastic bags. They'd hold it in the air and spin it, and if they didn't see anything, they wouldn't bother asking questions.

My question is, WTF do they think was in a wide mouthed Gatorade bottle covered in duct tape?

Usually, it was piss. Sometimes, another bag full of shit would be buried in the middle of the bag (presumably, someone couldn't get a watch relief). These things do not smell of roses when heated to 200°F and squished. 

So, coming home from my second cruise, us on nights get the job of cleaning out the Forward PWP, and prepping it all to offload at our last port (Jebel Ali, I think) before heading straight home (the rest of the plastic got held in the hangar bay in trash boxes until home).  We had to box up Trash Mountain (folks hadn't been doing the ""First In, First Out"" thing, so the heart of the mountain was ancient), and then clean the place. I wouldn't ask anyone else to do something I wouldn't do. Also, I didn't smoke at the start of this shit. At some point, though, I noticed the only people who hadn't vomited in the middle of carrying out 3 and 4 month old plastic bags of rotten food, piss, and shit, were the smokers. So, when we took an oxygen break, I went with them to the smoke pit, and bummed a Newport off of ol' Jake (not to be confused with young Jake). And with my sense of smell dulled by shitty tobacco and menthol, we finished up the night.

In the immediate aftermath, we cleaned the fuck out of that room. No shit, I would have willingly eaten off that floor after. The cleaning probably did more respiratory damage than the smoking. Also, with so many of our waste management duties suspended on the cruise home (fuck sorting, it all goes in the landfill! per the HMFICs), Forward PWP turned into the cards/nap/LAN party room. In the time I had left before EAOS, I became aware of the smoke pit culture (u/FluffyClamShell does a good job of describing it here [https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/ya7q07/popping\_smoke/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/ya7q07/popping_smoke/)), which actually helped me stay on top of shit for the remainder of my time in.

I quit cold turkey about a month before EAOS, as my wife-to-be would have ripped me a new asshole otherwise (God bless her, she's given me 2 great kids, and puts up with my dumb ass).

\*So, On ""Lazy"" Marines... As glamorous as the temporary duty was, the Navy did not opt to send its high achievers to it. The Marines, on the other hand (we had a Marine air wing embarked, with Marine F/A-18s) recognized that the amount of effort required for night shift guys in HAZMAT could be pretty low (compared to working in their air wing), and would cycle guys through so they could relax for a bit. Navy day shift khaki (E-7+) wanted the Marines on nights, because they were ""Lazy."" I(E-5)'d see those 2 guys (E-4 and E-3) at muster at the start and end of shift, and never had any fucking idea where they were in the in-between (just once, I needed to find them; I asked another random Marine, and they showed up 10 minutes later). However, the Aft PWP that they ran positively sparkled, and with half the machines, they processed twice the waste the forward guys did. No idea how they did it. I wasn't gonna ask, either. I assume they were magical in some way. I never once saw a reason to run them down when I toured that space, even at 3:00 AM.","1744"
"71","Well written. 

This one hit me kind of hard this morning, as I'm still on a Rollercoaster from yesterday. 

Yesterday? The Missing In America Veteran Recovery Program rendered final honors to thirteen veterans and two (unrelated) spouses who, for whatever reason, had lost contact with their family and, when they had passed, no one had claimed them. 

I'm one of the Arizona state chaplains, and with MIAP the chaplain is the face of the organization to those who help us render final honors. 

Nope, didn't know a single one of them. But I loved and respected every single one of them. I had no service connection to any of them, but my job was to memorialize their service. Chaplains may not ""belong"" to the grieving group, but we do grieve with you, and for you. 

Yesterday, the son and his family of one of the missing showed up, last minute. The son had lost contact with his father a few years ago, and the father had passed away, unknown to his family. Helluva way to get the news, when the genealogist is finally able to find you only days before your father's final service. A flag was folded, taps sounded, Amazing Grace sung, and the flag was presented to the son. 

So, yeah, your story today hit me pretty hard. Thank you for sharing it. Now I have to get back and try to work on this spreadsheet with tears in the corners of my eyes.

Our plane landed on a African red dust runway. The dust stick to its dark grey color. It didn't even turn off its engines, we load everything from our bags to our weapons and ammunition, what's left of it at least. It's time to head home.

Mission accomplished ? Yeah, they tell you that but you have that feeling that you could have done more. Missed opportunities, near-death experiences, sleepless nights and uneventful days. If chain of command wasn't full of people scared to do something that might cost them a promotion, we might have been more efficient.

No need to think about all that. We are going home. I am going home.

Not so fast soldier. First, we gotta land in a neighboring country in deep Africa for whatever reasons. You land at night and there's no one on the runway. An angry little French Air Force officer yells at you to get your stuff quickly and get the fuck out of the way. You go even slower. Who is this fucking cake-eater ? What does he know ?

You carry three heavy bags, your weapons, your plate carrier and helmet. You carry 5kg of dust and filth. Last shower was what ? 5 days ago ? 1 bottle of water was the best Army could do for you soldier.

No need to think about all that. We are going home. I am going home.

Unfortunately, they didn't plan food for you guys. We don't even make a sound. Always fucked, never surprised. At least, you have water. There's a 10 person tent allowed to us. 45 of us. Oh and there's no AC in it. We don't make a sound. We just put our bags where we can, laying against AC units that are cooling empty officers offices. At least, we don't have guard duty tonight.

Hell, they took all of our ammunition. I hate that. I've lived with those for 4 months and they saved my life and you take that away from me. I'm too tired to complain. I just want to sleep.

Another mean little person come yelling at us because we are sleeping on the ground. It doesn't sit right with this guy because it gives a bad image to the officers working in the area. The officers working an 8 to 5 job.

They treat us like animals. We are not supposed to be here. They just want to pass us to the next guy so we won't be their problem anymore. We are the unwanted. Brotherhood is only an idea for some, it seems.

I get angry. Those fuckers are the ones who sent us on this isolated FOB, hours from any allied forces. Now that we did our job, they don't want to deal with us ? I am disappointed. We talked so much about getting back, hoping for the food and a shower they would give us. Always fucked, almost never surprised.

I lay down against a hangar and the light above me is flickering. I light a smoke and just sit there like the professional soldier I should be. Mosquitoes are hunting us and you hear hands clapping all around. We talk about when we are going home and how Army is just a big fuck-up party that is good at make us believe they're organized. French Air Force officer's mother had a few new lovers that night it seems. We smoke all night and we share some army rations leftover. The night is slow and we talk about how are showers at home. Fuck water savings, I'm going to have a 45min shower.

A warm orange sun is rising slowly on the runway. Artificial lights are fading in the natural light getting stronger at every seconds. The Air Base is waking up. Slowly. I can smell eggs and bacon coming from the officer's mess. Fuck I don't drink coffee but I'd give my last smokes for it.

Another guy look for us and find a herd of dirty and restless souls. We do not even stand-up to salute. He has good news. They found us a shower unit and we will be able to take a quick shower. We better be fast, the water tank is almost empty. He also has bad news. They can't find our names on the passenger list for the flight back to France. Obviously.

We stand-up and close on the poor guy. He's told that he better find us a place on that plane or this base is going to have 45 angry dudes that don't have anything to lose right now. Officer or not he says he will do his best. I sure hope so.

Still no food. Still no rest area. We head for the showers.

I plan to shower fully dressed because I need to wash my combat clothes. We laugh and push each other as to be first in line. Our laughs are stopped pretty fast when the water turns out to be the color of dirt and goo and smells like decomposed meat. The first guys are yelling angry as they smell like a roadkill carcass. Dead rats and other animals are in there because they forgot to close the tank. Always fucked, never surprised. We will learn, later, that this shower unit has been abandoned months ago but was never unplugged from the electrical grid.

Guess I sweat for nothing while running to the showers.

I am back on my bags against the hangar. The light is still flickering. The sun is up.

I am wondering why did I signed up. Why did I abandon the comfort of a home, the loving arms of the woman of my life for this nonsense ? Yes my work has meaning for me. The disrespect I feel at that moment from the whole Army is limitless. How can they treat us like this ? We obey without asking questions, we endure for months and this is how they repay us ? I don't care about the money. I care about the brotherhood I believe in. I can't find it and I am sad.

No need to think about all that. We are going home. I am going home.

Fast forward a few hours. Medics heard about the decomposed rat shower and made us shower and sterilize everything. No shit, they don't want Cholera back to France. They find spots for all of us on the plane departing today. It's almost empty. Fuckers.

Moral is going up. We are clean, on our way home and food will be on the menu on the plane.

Before boarding an officer come and gather us. They are rerouting our plane to another Air Force base in France. Tens of hours away from our unit base. They have to quarantine us and test us for COVID. Obviously.

They don't know how they will be able to welcome us concerning food and sleeping conditions. They did not plan for our arrival. Officers in charge are not on site. They don't know how long we will wait.

Always fucked, never surprised.

The plane home is the longest of my life. It is only a few hours away.

Is that how they are welcoming us ? We fucking left our country for months and they don't even want us back.

I think about all that. We're not going home. I am not going home.

We land and another French Air Force officer yell at us to get the fuck away from the plane and to head to a hangar. It's France in winter. It's cold and we don't have winter clothes. We are waiting for hours in this hangar, doors fully open for the wind to come in. We are alone, no one is here for us.

They are waiting for nurses to come and do COVID tests on us. They will make us wait for 5 hours in the cold.

No words, poking in the nose, no words and we are on our way. They brought civilians buses to carry us to another hangar. We wait. We don't have smokes anymore.

We are still waiting for the bus that will bring us home.

We don't even talk to each other anymore. Disappointment will do that to you. Also, everyone is hoping and wants to talk about home. Better be silent than jinx it.

Bus comes. We board and we are on our 12 hours trip. Finally. I can't sleep. I look at the wheat fields on the side of the road. Wondering if this trip back home will ever end.

We arrive at my unit base at 02:00 AM. Colonel receives us :

*- ""Mission accomplished boys. We are so glad to have you all back. Don't rest too much, annual PT tests in 3 weeks. We have another mission planned for you guys, I know you're all eager to leave again. If one of you do not answer his phone during leave, better believe that he will regret it. Captain, (our unit commander for the mission) mandatory showers for everyone, you guys stink.""*

Warming welcome on a freezing deserted place in the middle of the night.

No need to think about all that. We are going home. I am going home.","1794"
"73","We have the same thing in emergency services.  The Final Radio Call.

I had to listen to the name of a good friend and local cop get called.  A dude who was always smiling, loved Babylon 5, loved to fish, and was expecting his first child.  Gunned down responding to not a crime, but a house fire.  Shot in the head by a psychopath who decided to end it all in a blaze of ""glory.""  My friend bled out while this monster exchanged fire with SWAT over his prone body.  Not half a mile from the college I was attending, where I met him.

What made me cry was hearing the dispatcher's voice break as she called out three times,  ""3Henry20, status check.""  It was so plaintive, like maybe this was all a horrid mistake and he'd somehow turned his radio off by accident.  But the radio remained silent.

Still miss you, buddy.  I talked to your wife a couple months ago, your kid is doing great in school.  Very smart, and a rather talented artist with colored pencils.  

Officer Rob Libke, Oregon City Police Department, 10-7 End of Watch, November 3rd, 2013.","1831"
"74","I'm a historically non-emotional person.

But roll call at a memorial service breaks me.  Just reading about it brings tears to my eyes as I recall the services I've attended over the years.","1856"
"75","Excellent writing. Brought a tear to my eyes. I love your writing. It’s a great honor to Lieutenant Spencer. 

I hope you’re doing okay buddy. Cheers.","1858"
"76","&gt;Another mean little person come yelling at us because we are sleeping on the ground.

What the fuck do you expect me to do, levitate? Fucking shrimp-dicked pencil pushers, they're lucky they haven't been within a mile of a live grenade since basic training or the law of attraction would have caused it to roll into their tent while they were sleeping on their cozy-ass cot.","1885"
"77","About 20 years ago (holy shit, it’s really been 20 years?!?), I left active duty with the 82nd Airborne and joined the National Guard. A few months in I was still adjusting to the new pace, and I was in the chow line behind my new boss.  I was an E5 and he was an E7.  He was a decent guy, part of the “good ol boys” club of people that had been in that unit for 20 years and had known most of them his whole life.  

The First Sergeant walked up behind him and loudly asked him in his very best First Sergeant voice “WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS??”  I think he was trying to impress on me that while they weren’t the 82nd, he could still run a disciplined unit.  The E7 turned to him and without removing his hands immediately replied “playing with my dink, First Sergeant.”  Top immediately walked away so nobody could see him cracking up.  That pretty much told me how the adjustment to the National Guard life was going to go. 

(That First Sergeant was a damn fine leader, better than many that I had in Division, so no knocks intended on him)","1912"

"81","When I was the Leading Chief Petty Officer (LCPO) at a large base in the far north an incident happened that I got embroiled in. LCPO's in the Coast Guard are not what Leading anythings (LPO, LCPO, etc.) in the Navy are. There's only one Leading anything at a base in the Coast Guard and that's one of the top two senior enlisted. Usually an E-8 (if no E-9's are assigned to the base) or the senior E-9.

One Saturday morning I was washing my truck in the hangar, which is how its done in the icy frozen far north. The Watch Captain (E-6 in charge of the duty crew during non-working hours) came running up to me in a panic. WTF? Very unusual.

Master Chief, I have a problem that's wayyyyy over my head.  I asked What's up? It turns out that one of his E-4's was pulling a prank on another E-4 who had left his CAC card (Essentially the new/current military ID that allows access to the CG's computer network) plugged into a computer but had walked away. A major No-No. COMSEC ya know. The E-4 pulling the prank had replied to an E-Mail sent to everyone in the duty section with an email of his own. It stated something like he (the owner of the adrift CAC card, and recipient of the prank) would not be able to comply due to being too busy and went on to explain what he would be doing. Let's just say it involved little boys and girls and involved some very illegal and immoral deeds.

The problem came into play when after he had hit the ""send"" button, he realized that he had sent it in reply, not to an email to just his duty section, but to one sent to every Coastie west of the Mississippi River as far as Hawaii. Up to, and including, the 3-Star Area Commander. Shit was about to hit the fan in a BIG way, and it was going to roll downhill like a snowball. I had 3 good guys that were about to learn the wrath of God.

The WC led me to the duo and I immediately felt bad for them. They looked like 1 pissed off dude (WC) who was looking at at the least would lose his position; 1 scared and pissed dude (adrift CAC card), who by leaving his CAC card in the computer when he went to take a piss was at the minimum going to get splashed by the splatter of the shit storm coming down the pipe, and the poor kid who sent the email.

Have you ever seen a mid-twenty-year-old man so afraid that he was white and shaking looking like he was going to cry? He looked like a 6-year-old kid who had been caught red handed eating a candy bar he had just shoplifted. His world, as he knew it, was about to end. And he knew it.

But it was now my problem. I had about 15 minutes before the shit show started. My thinking: The kid did something stupid and had to be taught a lesson. But on the other hand, he had immediately owned up to the fuck up and reported to the WC. But the punishment must be severe enough to satisfy the Gods.

I immediately sent him home. I then told the WC and rest of the duty section they were to have no contact with the kid.  Then I ordered the guy that left his CAC card in the computer to retake the on-line computer security course (part of the annual mandatory training that is long and tedious. It's painful to take) And sent them all back to work. I told the still very pissed off WC not to sweat it. I had it covered.

I then put up the best defense I could come up with by going on the offense and started making preemptive calls up the chain of command all the way to the CO. I told each what had occurred, and that I was on it. When asked how I handled it, I would just ask if they really wanted to know? I only had one person in the chain of command insist that I tell him what I did. (Oh shit! What do I tell him?) I answered, Sir, before I tell you I request an email from you stating you are ordering me to answer that question and a guarantee that no legal charges will be preferred upon my person. (Fuck it. Let his imagination run.)

I was later told that Monday morning that the shitstorm was indeed waiting for the CO when he came to work but was averted when the CO repeated to whomever called him it was all taken care of by his LCPO and stated it shouldn't happen again. When pressed, he then repeated what I had told the overly inquisitive member of the Chain of Command who insisted I tell them what I did. Apparently senior command had talked. I guess no one wanted to open that can of worms as nothing more was said of the incident.

What did I do to the original offender, you ask? Why, nothing. Not all punishment need be physical. Fear of the unknown can be overwhelming. I had essentially sentenced the poor kid to two days of living in his head. Fearing the worst. He was a basket case come Monday morning. He stated he hadn't slept, hadn't eaten, had not done anything but think and beat himself up mentally. I took him to breakfast, gave him the required speech, and sent him home for some much-needed solid sleep.

To my knowledge, no one ever found out who actually sent the email outside the duty section. I do know that rumors of what happened to him flew, getting bigger and better as time passed. For a while, people would see me coming and walk the other way so as not to ""piss off the Master Chief."" But I never had another computer issue.

And I drove that truck around for a week only half washed.

&amp;#x200B;

My time in the Marines was rapidly headed toward a close in 2012, and I was hoping to end the relationship on a good note. However, the Marine Corps can sense when you’re trying to play nice, and it never failed to make Marines regret it. I was now stationed at HQMC in the Pentagon, a floor or two down from the Commandant of the Marine Corps’ (CMC) office, and I had gotten to know the CMC’s Comm Team pretty well. These Marines are supposed to be the best of us communicators and therefore were a source of fascination for the average IT dink.

First there was SSgt Johnson, the usual bro-dude who was good at comm but otherwise kind of rough and quiet. Then there was their chief, GySgt Barber[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/submit#_ftn1) who was atypical in his gift for rubbing other Marines, of all ranks, the wrong way. And then there was SSgt McQueen.

SSgt McQueen was a real oddity. He wasn’t particularly tall or bulging with muscles, but he was nevertheless a monster when it came to physical training. He had all the martial arts belts, maxed out the physical fitness tests, the combat fitness tests,[\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/submit#_ftn2) the swim qualifications, everything. He knew computers and networks inside and out. Above all else, McQueen was almost supernaturally likeable. Not only were the physical and professional challenges of being a Marine easy for Q, you couldn’t even hate on him for it because he was a genuinely good human being on top of it all. He was the Marine Corps' own Captain Carrot.*

I expected him to be above average because Marines don’t get to serve on the CMC’s personal team unless they are so far above the rest that most of us never even see them. The CMC Comm Team knew that, and it was routine for them to flex on the rest of us like the peasants we were. But when SSgt McQueen came down to our humble little shop to get assistance with the occasional oddball request, he didn’t carry on with the arrogance of someone who damn well knows he could put any one of us in the dirt with his own prowess, whatever the contest. He was always smiling, kind, friendly, and gracious. No matter how high the pressure, how short-fuse the demands, or how difficult the fix, McQueen just didn’t seem to mind ass pain.

We became friends, so when he showed up at the shop one day with an off-brand tablet device/thing, I was happy to help. The CMC, like many flag officers, was into new gadgets in a big way, and he seemed to feel that stating a wish out loud made it become possible. Therefore, he regularly made insane demands of his staff. Flag officers are Aladdin, and we, the Marines, have to come together to be their genie. 

SSgt McQueen came to the front desk, smiling and waving to the troops at Helpdesk, holding the tablet along with its charger in his other hand. I came out from my office to greet him.

“Hey, Q! How’s it going?” 

“Hiya, Fluffy! I need some help setting up the Commandant’s new toy here. You got a minute?” 

It wasn’t a real question. If the CMC wants something, every Marine has as many minutes as it requires. There was a rule forbidding IT devices in the shop that weren’t authorized, but this was going to be an exception because of course it was.

“Yep, come on in. What’s going on?”

“Gen Amos wants to use this on the upcoming trip, and I’m trying to get it configured so it will connect to the right network automatically. Can you help?”

“I mean, yeah but …” 

I was a bit lost. Q was more than equal to the task of connecting a device without help. Why would that bring him all the way down here? 

“Is it like, hardwired?""[\[4\]](https://www.reddit.com/submit#_ftn4)

“Nope. It needs to use wireless.”

“Shit. Well, that hasn’t been approved by security yet, but we can probably get an exception with some paperwork.”

Q winced, and I realized that he hadn’t gotten to the bad part yet. He was working up to it. Suspicions blossomed in my mind like poisonous flora. 

“Q … what’s the real issue here?”

Giving me an apologetic smile, Q finally got to the point. 

“He…wants it on wireless on the high side network. Not the unclassified network.” 

“Fucking WHAT?” 

If anyone else had said that I would’ve thrown them out of the shop then and there. To translate, what the CMC wanted was a tablet that connected to specific networks via magical airwaves *while* he took it on travel with him to foreign countries. Anyone involved with our information security would be apoplectic at the mere suggestion. Q knew this as well as I did. There wasn’t any sort of configuration anywhere in the Marine Corps to allow something like this. Q, however, had his message to Garcia, so here we were, with a stock device straight out the box and a “request” that we create a way for this blatant violation of security to happen and to happen seamlessly. 

I took a deep breath and then decided that since I didn’t really have a choice, I might as well see what I could do. If nothing else, pioneering a method for this might get me one last award on my way out of the Corps.

“What’s the timeframe?” 

“Oh, we’ve got some time. We’re not leaving on a trip until Thursday,” Q said blithely. 

“Are you out of your freaking mind?!? You’re talking about going all the way up to joint comms and getting whole new systems online, approved, tested, secured… Q, this is impossible. Seventy-two hours is simply not enough time.” 

I knew saying what the CMC wanted couldn’t be done wasn’t going to win me friends, and I’d probably look utterly incompetent if Q found a way to pull it off anyway. But seriously, this was insane.

Q sighed, but his sunny disposition would not accept defeat in the face of such small obstacles as overwhelming reality. 

“Let’s just plug it in and see what it looks like. I’ve never set one of these up before. Just on regular internet.”

I stayed late that night, working with Q to see if there was some shortcut we could do, maybe make a special VPN, whatever we could to make it work for now. Around 2000, we finally reached some sort of compromise that, while it wouldn’t be allowed on controlled networks, could work well enough for the mission.

Yawning, I stretched and leaned back in my chair. Goddamn, these chairs suck. 

“Q, what made this come up so last minute?”

Q shrugged. 

“I dunno. He’s already got an iPad that does this.”

Wait. *What?*

Slowly, I repeated back Q’s words: “He already has an iPad… on the wireless?”

Keeping his eyes on the screen, Q chirped, “Yep!”

I felt myself starting to get angry. Did I just sit here for six hours trying to reinvent the wheel and … it just … it already … are you fucking kidding me?

“We’ve been sitting here … struggling with this weird-ass technology … and he already…”

Q stabbed the screen with a finger and closed out of the applications. 

“I know, right? He only wants it so he can have pictures of his grandchildren without switching networks.” 

Q stood up, twisting his torso to unknot his back muscles. 

“Thanks, Fluff, I appreciate it! See ya around!”

"84","Dear Reader, have you ever found yourself hopelessly pondering an unanswerable Life Question? I have yet to make any notable progress, but I continually ponder the most unanswerable Life Questions. I mean, being the first to solve one of these many Life Questions is a sure to be met with an unmeasurable level of gratitude. I understand my quest may be futile, but they will never be answered if fools like me dare not ponder.

**F**ruitless **A**nd **H**umbling **Q**uestions, abbreviated as (**FAH-Q**)

1. How valuable does one’s life need to be for a murder to be categorized as an assassination?
2. Can we really ponder a world without hypothetical solutions?
3. Why is “Slept like baby” used to describe satisfying slumber when all parents know freshly minted Crib-Midgets wake every two hours to eat and/or produce bum-slugs?
4. Do we really need to make appointments with psychics?
5. Just, **EXACTLY WHAT**, was Hawk thinking when he did…?

Dear Reader, the last baffling question produced many of sleepless nights during my tenure as Hawk’s first-line supervisor. It was certainly mentally unhealthy, but I frequently ponder Hawk’s thought process. My savior during these tragic mental bouts were the poetic words of the great poet Homer J. Simpson. “The first step to failure, is trying.”

**F**iguring **A H**awk’s **Q**uestionable **M**ethodology **E**nrages, appropriately abbreviated as (**FAHQ-ME**)

As stated in a previous Post, my discussion with Parker illuminated multiple Hawk stories. Welcome to the other Dear Reader. I will start said story after my inappropriately placed rant. Parker and I discussed many **H**awk **O**ne-**L**iners **Y**ou **S**hould **H**ear **I**mmediately **T**hough.

**HOLY SHIT!!!**

Honestly, HOLY SHIT! My brain is so fantastical that I typed “Hawk One-Liners You Should Hear Immediately Though” and then realized my unintended brilliance. Did you know Columbus was dead set on finding a direct water route from Europe to Asia but failed? Epic fail, right?!? Well, Columbus accidently discovered America. I honestly believe my unintended brilliance holds me in the high esteem of Columbus. Excluding the sexual slavery, general slavery, tyrannical torture of indigenous people, and all the other horrible shit of course. Strictly acronym and America parallels here.

**HOLY SHIT – Leadership Moments**

**Uno**

Leader: Sloppy, the Battalion Commander caught Hawk peeing off Tower One.

Sloppy: Again?

**Secondo**

First Sergeant: Why is Hawk at the Aid Station now?

Sloppy: Entangled himself in C-Wire (Concertina-wire).

First Sergeant: Again?

**Trifecta**

Sloppy: “I thought he was just really hungry Sergeant!”

*Thunderous screaming from Company Command Post, at the opposite end of building*

*Irate First Sergeant, because…*

First Sergeant: **HAWK. IF. I. SEE. That SHIT-EATING-GRIN AGAIN. I am going to** (*Voice Level One-Hundred Percent And Then Some*) **I will FUCK-START YOUR FACE WITH** (Pointing) **HIS DICK!**

*Teammates all staring with “Wow-Faces.”*

**Five Spot**

*Towel-wearing Hawk returns from shower*

*Singing*

*A Hawk original*

*Brady waits for Hawk to wear anything other than towel*

*It’s on like Donkey Kong – “playful” physical violence initiated*

*Hawk is not built to win, anything*

*Except…*

Hawk: (Painful Grunts) Don’t drag me to the floor. (*Noises*) If I get muddy from the floor (Loud Painful Scream) I am showering, **AND JACKING OFF TO YOUR…**

*Brady learns some fights are not worth winning*

**ACTUAL STORY**

Hawk was my Soldier and I was therefore responsible for educating the young and mentally feeble Hawk. There are many Dear Readers who have read and reread every single Hawk saga. However, even these most knowledgeable of Dear Readers cannot fathom how difficult it was to “learn Hawk.” Seriously, teaching a pig why super-ion-beams and advanced target concepts are vital for effective thermonuclear microbomb rocket propulsion is a more achievable goal. There was a “supply-chain shortage” on intellectual output and commonsense throughput during the creation of Hawk. Also, despite their superb intelligence, there is a dire shortage of pigs in Iraq.

Dear Reader: Wait, I know for a fact you can get pork in Iraq.

Sloppy: Pork? Teaching a Boston Butt thermonuclear microbomb rocket propulsion is preposterous. I required the entire Bacon-Baby, and they were not offered in my patch of Iraq.

There was a lot of trial-and-error, but I would eventually learn that Hawk could also learn. And what a tragic revelation that became. They were never vitally important triumphs, and certainly nothing worth writing home for. They were much better suited for Reddit twenty-years later. Dear Reader, I taught Hawk how to circumvent some of the restrictions imposed at our FOB (Forward Operating Base) internet café.

We were not as technologically showered during the 2000’s. Sending an email was more akin to the local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Take a number. Ponder Life Questions. Get lucky, and then spend a luxurious twenty-minutes waiting for a webpage to populate, only to regret every single life choice that led you to “that” specific ass-sweat-soaked chair, and leaving before your time is up.

Dear Reader, I was never a quitter. I still went to the internet café. I simply altered my objective. I was now strictly hunting laughs. Double-U, Double-U, Double-U Porn dot com had no chance of bypassing a DISA (Defense Information Security Agency) filter. Yes, I am aware there are ways, but time management was critical. I immediately set the Screen and Sleep setting to one-minute, and then proceeded to Wikipedia.

**Please see below Wikipedia link**

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Autofel.svg/1024px-Autofel.svg.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Autofel.svg/1024px-Autofel.svg.png)

Some of you may have bypassed the link. I am only slightly offended, because you are clearly new to Sloppy stories, and fail to understand I would never mislead you.

**Recap**

1. Sleep time set to one minute
2. Open Wikipedia
3. Wait for next opening computer and immediately float seats when another computer opens for the duration of my allotted time
4. Make wild accusations when prey transitions to victim

This was one of the very few things Hawk would commit to memory during the entire deployment. I had inadvertently developed a Wikipedia prodigy. He was dedicated too. Hawk would ensure he had a healthy Teammate buffer in line to immediately come to his defense and counter factual accusations with Fake News. Lastly, I should mention this specific Wikipedia picture was not a sketch during the early 2000’s. It was an incredibly limber real-life human.

**Internet Café**

1. Teammates login before Hawk
2. Hawk logs in and immediately sets screen sleep timer to one-minute and navigates to Wikipedia
3. More Teammates login after Hawk
4. Hawk relocates to different computer and waits

**Scenario One**

Teammate: What the fuck are you looking at?

Victim: (Shock-and-Awe) I wasn’t looking at it. It was already up.

Teammate 2: You pervy fuck!

Victim: I swear it was not me…

**Scenario Two**

Teammate: What the fuck are you looking at?

Prey (With Fight): Bullshit. It was (Pointing at Hawk) that guy. He moved…

Teammate 2: No. **BULLSHIT**! I seen you login and pull it up you nasty bastard.

Prey Becomes Victim: *Attention is bad.* ***CLOSE TAB. CLOSE TAB. CLOSE TAB!***

**Scenario Three**

*Fast-forward*

Teammate: What the fuck are you looking at?

Not Prey: Fuck you dude, it’s free porn!

Dear Reader, I am unhappy to report this sequence of events became a staple. It started with post-victory laughing. It then transitioned into tally keeping. Then tally keeping became refined by Victim-Prey criteria. Then tobacco betting became a serious high-or-low for some Soldiers.

Dear Reader: This has to get old at a small FOB, right?

Yes, it certainly did. Then the shenanigans transitioned to adjacent Super FOBs. They were a glorious place where the near-beer flows like grape juice where the beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of Capistrano. Places where internet cafés had enough empty computers for Hawk to ravage half the computers. So many so, Soldiers swore computer viruses also flocked like the salmon of Capistrano. Which leads me to the reason why this became an unhappy learning revelation. My Battalion Command Sergeant Major was unphased because this was comical. The Super FOB leadership did not share the same sentiments.

Sloppy: **HAWK!!!** Why is First Sergeant yelling at you now?

Hawk: (Shit-Eating-Grin) For all the autofellatio screen savers we put at FOB NAME today.

***Hysterical laughter***

***Loud footsteps***

***Footsteps getting closer***

***Highly engineered plywood door with water-bottle-closing-system KICKED OPEN***

***First Sergeant stares at Hawk***

***Hawk wins, First Sergeant laughs***

***First Sergeant looks at Sloppy***

***Failed composure attempt***

First Sergeant: Sloppy. I get it. This shit is hilarious, **BUT IF I GET ANOTHER CALL FROM SUPER FOB CSM, I’m now going to use your dick to FUCK START HIS FACE!**

**Door slams**

**Footsteps fade**

First Sergeant: **FUCK! FUUUUUUUUCCCCCKKKKK. They don’t pay me enough for this shit!**

Sloppy: Hawk…

Hawk: I never told him you taught me Sergeant.

Sloppy: (Failed Composure) Shit stops **right here, right now.**

Hawk: (Hawk Grin) Still never told him…

Sloppy: Because I would make you limber enough to fuck start your own face!

*No-fail Hawk*

Hawk: Because my dick is so biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiggggggggggg!

The End

Friendly reminder folks. I have brilliant former Teammates, and I this is some advice I received awhile back. Set calendar reminders on your phones for Holidays, Anniversaries, and Random Dates. When those alarms go off we simply text, “I was just thinking about you and…” you’ll be making a world of change. We police our own this year, and we can thankfully repeat this next year. Seems insignificant to some but is life-or-death for our Brothers and Sisters. Please feel free to invade my DMs because I will always be an ear.

Happy New Cheers,

Sloppy

*I’m French. I’m in the Army. I’m in the infantry and fucking proud of it. I do love embracing the suck and I always took everything with that « fuck it » mindset.*

I am sure a lot of you guys have been deployed during the end of year festivities and spent Christmas away from your God-given family but surrounded by your Army-given one. You all know it has a certain... taste ?

Let me give you my insight on how I experienced it.

You receive your new orders and you will be deploying to the end of the year until the beginning of the next. It is not your first one, you're excited. Behind the excitation you have this little voice that warns you about the talk you will have once you're home. You'll have to hide this excitement and understand what they are going through.

They are worried, sad and disappointed. Worried that something will happen to you. You dodged and played with life before and you're going back like the lesson wasn't enough. They will wonder how long you'll be able to be lucky. They are sad. Sad because you'll be gone and it will be hard to talk to you from another continent. Disappointed because, once again, you won't be here for the winter, won't be here for the annual family gathering.

They dread the endless questions about how you're doing, where are you deployed, is it dangerous, when are you coming home and your annoying family member who did 1 year of mandatory service in a back shop in a sleepy base that try to explain to them what you're going through and how they should be proud.

You tell them that you're sorry to deploy, again. You hope they won't remember that you've been in country only for 8 months before being gone again. You just have this sorry face and can't find the right words to help calm their worries. You're not good at this. You're good at doing Army stuff but you're this incompetent man in social interactions with the ones who really matter.

They are used to it do not worry. As long as you come back in one piece, it will be alright. They know that they can't put everything on your shoulders because you have to be focused on the tasks to come.

\---

It's been a couple months. Christmas is near and you're getting a bit tired of deployment. You have your habits, good and bad. The food is always the same and if you can get your hands on smokes and alcohol, the night is better. You sleep better with a buzz. Chain of command is trying to organize a Christmas party as to gather all the brothers and sisters together. Esprit de corps. Obviously chain of command will do a half-ass job because they were never trained to be managers even though it's what they are supposed to do day to day.

You are used to it and your small combat group is organizing its own party. Fuck everybody. You saved booze and smokes for weeks for this one night. Guard duty is boring and you just think about home and you're tired of that. You need that stress relief. One authorized opportunity to drink more than usual.

You miss them. They are back home leaving work for the Christmas holidays. They tell you how stressful work was for the past weeks, tell you all about the planning they have to go through to organize the road trip to the family gathering. You listen from a distant ear, you kind of shut down as to protect your morale. You tell them you wish to be with them all but... is that really true ? Think hard about it. I didn't think so.

Only thinking about the rain of questions you will get. How you will have to stand at a nice dinner table, not smoke while eating and drinking. No trash talk or a naked buddy dancing with his rifle just to make you all laugh. Obviously, you miss them but you're not sure how comfortable you would be in a social gathering like this one.

*""How was it ? Was it dangerous ? Did you take fire ? I hope you killed a lot of them ! It was hard ? Well you signed up for this dummy hahaha !""...* You know that you have the same sorry face from a few months before.

Your team leader is drinking shots of cheap vodka out of a .50 cal casing. Another is just video recording and laughing with tears in its eyes. Your buddy just got out of guard duty and is drinking out of the bottle. You're in the middle of this and looking around. You're with a bunch of weirdos, perverts and surprising personalities in the middle of a foreign country where people outside of your hesco walls wants to kill you. Yet, you feel safe with them, safer than anywhere in the world. They are your safe space.

Chain of Command organized a Secret Santa thingy but infantrybois being what they are, we're just offering porn collections, dirty socks for the one with feet fetish, OnlyFans subscriptions and second hand fleshlights. Chain of Command is horrified but who the fuck cares. We're supposed to only drink beers but we reek of whisky and vodka. They know, we know that they know but what can they do to all of us. Extra PT ?

You have a buzz and your phone rings. Family is calling. You look at it for a few seconds, hesitating between doing what you should and what you want. You have that one night to have real fun with the boys but family is waiting on your sorry face.

You go in a dark part of the FOB, where you have better internet and you press on that WhatsApp answering button. The light hurt your drunk eyes and you try to make a good figure.

*""Here's our little soldier ! How are you doing ? Happy Christmas ! How's it...Where are yo...You look tir...""*

They all talk altogether and the one that matters holds the phone and looks at you. They know that you are overwhelmed by the others here. They get in a few seconds what is your mental state, they saw it last Christmas on the same frontal camera.

You answer to what you hear. They are all happy, well dress in a well lit living room. Your screen is the only light on your face. They hope you're doing okay and that you're eating well. They all tell you to be safe. They go back to their life.

*""Merry Christmas back home ! See you all soon""*

You hang up and you don't see shit in the dark. You just lay against this armored vehicle and light a smoke. You don't even understand what happened. You hear your boys laughing and you just walk guided by the comforting sound of your safe place. You go back to your life.

Buddy who came out of guard duty didn't bother to get his gear off and just show the porn video he masturbates to in the bunker. We just hit him with beer cans while laughing, saying how disgusting he is, thinking about the time we did the same. One genius cook is making improved army rations and they are delicious. You drink more, you enjoy it because you don't have a lot. You sing Christmas songs and Army songs. You obviously joke about how the other is gay because he'd rather suck a dick than do a second tour in this shit hole. Life is good.

You feel better when you forget about home. You feel guilty but that is the reality of it.

\---

You're back home. The whole family is here and you're the main focus point. Mind you, you like telling stories so it's okay. You're smart enough to tell the correct ones. They laugh and you're happy that they can understand some of it.

Do not close up. You slowly realize that you were protecting yourself out there. Were you angry because family couldn't understand what you were living ? Saying always the same bullshit you've heard hundreds of time ? It's not their fault, they don't know any better and that's a good thing. You know it.

Although, you have your moments and that family member that tells you :

*""Hey, you say it was hard but you signed up for this ! Can't complain now""*

Fuck you. We all thought it but kept it silent so that your girlfriend is not embarrassed, so your mother is not disappointed. In reality, fuck you.

You simply lash out by telling a real story, you want to provoke and show how tough you can be. Don't bother, they don't know any better and that's a good thing. You know it.

You go back to your life. Life is good. They ask you if you will be here next Christmas. You genuinely don't know but you wonder :

*""Merry Christmas !""*

Is it better over the phone or with them ?

\---

*Merry Christmas to you all brothers and sisters from all around the world. I truly hope you are all doing okay.*

*To all of you deployed, do the effort to talk to family. You might dread it now but it's worth it in the end.*

*I know, we know, that this is a difficult period of the year for a lot of us. Do not hesitate to reach out to your brothers and sisters.*

*You might need it, they might too.*

*Do not forget about your safe space, it will never entirely disappear.*

*---*

*If you feel alone or need a talk, reach out to me. Send me a chat and I'll be here. I'll be here because you guys are becoming my safe space.*

*Thank you, truly.*

"94","About 3 weeks after the storm hit, life was pretty good and routine. I still didn't have my SUV back so was totally reliant on the electric golf Kart that the CO had given me upon my return from NAS Meridian 4 days after the storm hit. Now this kart was a little unique as it had a front seat, back seat, and a 3 foot flat deck behind the back seat, as well as a Bimini (canvas roof). I had adorned it with a 3 foot by 4 foot Coast Guard flag on the back left hand corner (my best impression of Pappy Boyington's exploits in WWII). 

It was my only transportation and was used for everything - from smuggling beer into NOLA, to making my nightly runs, to just moving my sleek and trim ass (I say this cause I can't say it anymore) wherever I needed to go. I also went nowhere without my igloo cup. It was one of those huge plastic cups with a huge handle with a lid that kept drinks cold. It was also pink. Why PINK? I mean I had a green, blue and red one at home as well! I figured no one would ever ""appropriate"" it, it really screwed with younger folks' heads (back then) when the old man was carrying a pink cup, and it actually did keep whatever I was drinking as cold as possible.

One day I went to the completed trailer park for some reason. As was my norm I sat my cup down somewhere as I walked around. When my business was done, I went back to where I sat the cup down and it wasn't there! When I asked if anyone saw my cup, instead of a bunch of people pointing, agog, at the pink cup, no one had seen it. So we started an expanding square search.

Someone finally spotted it sitting on the ground, right where I parked my kart - which wasn't there. I bellowed WHERE'S MY KART?????  To say I was pissed was a massive understatement. Every spare person I could find I tasked with looking all over the Coast Guard Air Station for it figuring someone was screwing with me for kicks. It wasn't on the air station.

I contacted my buddies at base security and asked them to look for it. Coupla hours late.... crickets. It disappeared. By now I was fucking pissed beyond belief! I was stranded. No way to get to my meetings and appointments or get around to anywhere! I went the next night to the town hall meeting (a meeting of all the senior enlisted from all branches of the service and different units stationed at JRB New Orleans) and let them know what happened and, to say this nicely, let them know how pissed I was. I think the wallpaper came off the wall from all my F bombs and yelling and cussing and what I was going to do the perpetrator when I found him.

Crickets. No one had seen it.

The next day, after walking everywhere for 3 days, base security rolled into the air station and asked for me. It was a friend who sheepishly asked for me and told me the kart was found and offered me a ride to it. He drove me to the Air Force Air Guard Base across the base. I was met by a couple air force dudes with smirks on their faces which went completely unnoticed. I was led into a hangar where I was met by an older guy sitting on a stool surrounded by 20-30 people. He was wearing a flight suit without a name tag so I had no idea what his rank was. And behind him was MY kart, sans the Coast Guard flag.

I started by bellowing, ""WTF are you doing with my kart?"" The gentleman on the stool said quietly, It's not your kart. I argued But it is!! Nope was his rely. I asked to explain. It was about then I noticed my Coast Guard flag hanging amongst the unit's ""Love me wall"" (where all the units' citations and awards they've been awarded over the years hang). It was about 20 feet off the deck and pretty close to dead center.

Gentleman on the stool states, the kart belongs to our commanding general, and we decided to give it back to him. I hear snickers from the junior folks standing around this faux boxing arena. I argued back that my CO gave it to me to use, as I flash back to I had never seen the kart before the hurricane. Shit Shit Shit Shit Shit, After a few minutes of mumbling, I was excused by the generic gentleman on the stool and told to have a nice day. Outright laughter ensued.

Embarrassed and at a total loss, I walked back halfway across the base to the CG air station. I looked for the CO. When I found him I asked, Skipper where did you get the kart? My worst fears were realized when he said that at the first meeting of the senior leadership on base, the air force CO lent it to him. Shit shit shit shit shit. And they still had my Coast Guard flag!

I went back to the air force hangar and asked to talk to the person in charge holding my flag hostage. While eating shit the whole time, I related what I found out and noticed my flag was no longer on the wall. Again, the laughter all around me. He handed me back my flag without a word.

**AFTERMATH:**  Two days later the kart showed up back parked in my parking spot. My CO found me and said that when the AF commanding general was presented back his kart, he apparently asked why I wasn't in possession? Whomever thought they were doing the general a favor found out different. I will never know. But he ordered I be given it back.

"99","My brother was quite… clever. Keep in mind it’s been a few years since he told me this story. ALSO keep in mind that although I believe him, I cannot confirm this happened. I also wouldn’t be surprised if he was just trying to make me laugh. He’s a great storyteller. So if this is impossible, keep this in mind. (Also keep in mind his discipline record has notes on it, if I recall)

See, he was in Iraq or Afghanistan at the time, and his post juuust so happened to be out of view from most people who didn’t go out of their way to get a good angle. As a result, there weren’t video feeds trained on him.

(Little context about him: My brother was a little bastard as a kid. He once chased another boy down, outran the other kids bike, tackled him into a freshly fertilized field and shoved warm horse shit in his mouth. It was still slightly green and slopped through his fingers.)

One day, he gets an idea. He has a buddy slip him rubbers, filled them with water, and when it was dark out or people just weren’t looking he’d move out of position and drop the condoms over their heads. Naturally, this pissed a lot of people off.

One day, one of these rubbers fell from the heavens right onto someone-a-higher-rank’s head. This superior went up to my brothers post and started berating him - to which my brother responded ‘With a look of awe pointed toward the sky capable of rivaling a virgin nun’ and insisted he wasn’t at fault for ‘God gracing you with water’.

So, this superior takes it up with others. The other ones tell water-boarded superior my brother is a known ass, but without proof, they weren’t gonna do shit.

Well, mail day comes. My brother had run out of condoms and wrote a letter to his wife asking her to “send a shit ton of water balloons and not mention it to anyone or ask why”. Lo and behold, his superior hands it to him directly.

Water-Boarded Superior: What’s in the box, (Brother’s last name)?

Brother: *Staring at the container clearly labeled water balloons* I don’t know. I haven’t opened it yet.

WB Superior: Open the box, BLN.

Brother: It is my right to not be coerced into sharing my private correspondence without proper reason.

WB Superior: Dammit, BLN. If you don’t fess up now, shit’s comin’ from the north.

Brother: Fess up to what!? I didn’t open it yet, how do I know what’s in there!?

The superior ended up not leaving with proof since he was told he couldn’t confiscate Brothers mail. But, he DID set someone up near Bro’s post.

And bro managed to let a balloon fall every. Single. Time.

They installed a fucking camera and he still managed to find a blind spot.

He said, “When my tour ended, I had at least 5 men who despised me.”","2896"
"100","For those who haven't been in the military, or never had the occasion to work with the amazing [Browning M2 .50 machine gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M2_Browning) (or ""Ma Duece"" as everyone has called it since Vietnam), allow me to explain the title.

Tolerances are a thing. If you are talking about tightening a lugnut on your car wheel, you don't have to tighten it to the point you are hurting yourself, but it should be pretty tight. However, when you are reassembling a gun, rifle or pistol, you'd damn sure better have it put together right. The pieces that should move, should do so smoothly. The pieces that should not move had better not. 

Headspace refers to bolt of the gun that moves to fire the round and case for the bullet both being in alignment. If they aren't, it can jam. Worse, you can have premature firing or even have rounds ""cook off"" in the chamber, exploding it in your face. Timing refers to making sure the gun fires only when the gun is recoiling. There is a ""key"" that helps you set this correctly. (I understand the new version of the M2 is a bit different and easier to use, but I was out long before it was fielded.) 

So, given how important it is and how catastrophic failure can be, ""Headspace and timing"" took on meanings in the Army. Such as, ""Check your headspace and timing - that's not going to work"" meaning ""I think that is a bad idea."" Or, ""How is your headspace and timing?"" could mean, ""How is your mental health?"" It could also mean someone really fucked up because they weren't thinking. It gets used as an insult. Enough background.

This is a story about the headspace and timing in a (negative sense) of several soldiers I worked with, and their love affair with boots of all things. 

One of the things they taught us in Basic training was Army regulation 670-1, which covers wear and appearance of the uniform. It gets updated as new uniform pieces come out, as regulations regarding shaving and tattoos change, etc. You spend hours spread over two months learning how to wear the uniform correctly, the history of the uniform, etc. Because of that fact, none of the characters in this story had any excuse for their actions. They couldn’t claim ignorance.

When I was at Ft. Bliss, we were authorized to wear only two styles of boots with our BDU’s – the standard black leather Combat Boots or the standard Jungle Boots in either black or green. That’s it.  If you were in your dress uniform (Class A’s or B’s), you had to wear those really uncomfortable dress shoes that go with it. If you were on Airborne qualified and on Jump status with an Airborne unit, you could wear the Jump Boots. Today's Army is a **LOT** more lax on footwear. Generally (as I understand it) it needs to be a 8"" tall military style boot in a a certain narrow range of colors.

I’d been there maybe a month when we got a few new guys. PVT X was one of them. This genius heard that 11th Air Defense Brigade was attached to XVIII Airborne corps and decided that made him Airborne. We were NOT an Airborne unit. Our attachment to XVIII Airborne merely meant that we were the first ADA assets to deploy in the event of war. That's why we were the second Army assets on the ground in Saudi for Desert Storm, right behind the Rangers. Several members of my unit had been to Air Assault and/or Airborne school, but the unit itself was not on jump status. But this dumb Private decided to go to the clothing store on post and buy Jump Boots right after he gets to the unit. None of us knew this right away, or someone would have said something to him so he could have returned them before they were polished and worn. I'm not even sure why the Ft. Bliss clothing store sold Jump boots, since we had no units on jump status on post. The closest thing we had was the Rangers - they came though White Sands via Ft. Bliss for the desert phase of Ranger school when when they still did that. 

Beginning of the month. We fall out for inspection in our Class A uniforms for our monthly inspection. PVT X comes strolling out to the quad in his Class A’s. He was wearing his Jump Boots. Jump Boots are like Combat boots but a slightly flashier style. You are only authorized to wear them If you are Airborne qualified AND if you are in an Airborne unit on jump status. Not only was he wearing his Jump Boots, he had bloused his dress pants into his boots, like an Airborne soldier. He came to us fresh from AIT and was *not* Airborne qualified, not that it would have mattered. He proudly strutted out to formation and took his place with our platoon. A few of us snickered but didn’t get a chance to say shit as we were called to attention. None of the NCO’s in our formation noticed right away because they were having some kind of pow-wow until the CO came out to start the party. The tension was palpable with us enlisted guys. We all could feel the aura of doom surrounding this poor soul.

Inspection starts. The platoon daddy goes down the rows, points out a few small things. One guy got chewed out for not having a ribbon on he had earned. Another for his gig line. Etc. One guy even got yelled at because he had been promoted to E3 but didn’t go get the brass rank insignia for his dress uniform, so he was wearing the E2 insignia. Dumbasses. All of their headspace and timing was off if they thought they would pass inspection. That's why I spent a good hour or two the night before getting my shit right.

Then they get to the back row.

“WHAT IN THE FUCKING HELL ARE YOU WEARING PRIVATE X!?!? ARE THOSE MOTHERFUCKING JUMP BOOTS?” Half of us started to giggle, but were trying hard to keep composure and remain at attention. Besides the giggles, my eardrums hurt. The platoon daddy was NOT fucking happy. He was going off on this kid like R. Lee Ermey. The shouting from two rows back was deafening.

“Have you been to Airborne school Private? Are you on jump status? Are you getting jump pay? Do you see anyone here wearing berets? DO YOU SEE ANY OF US WEARING PARACHUTES OR LOADING ONTO A C-130? DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHERE THE FUCK BIGGS ARMY AIRFIELD IS FROM HERE? IS YOUR HEADSPACE AND TIMING OFF? DO YOU NEED ME TO ADJUST IT?” Sadly for PVT X, we still had not been designated an active Airborne asset in the last 30 seconds.

This poor kid stood there in shock. He wasn’t sure what question to answer first. He didn’t know what headspace and timing was because he hadn’t been qualified on the Ma Deuce. He stood there sputtering, and before long was getting smoked. “Shut up, Private! I don’t want to hear shit you have to say. DROP AND START PUSHING UNTIL I AM TIRED!” For those who don’t know, that means he was doing “corrective physical training” which is usually push-ups. In his dress uniform. So it sucked double.

This poor kid – went and wasted money on boots he couldn’t return to the clothing store on post, and could never wear them again. 

So no shit, there I was. The next fucking day. As in, 24 hours later. I'm not kidding. Another new private, PVT Y, falls out to first formation after morning PT. He at least wasn’t wearing Jump boots, but it was almost as bad. Tanker boots.

Tanker boots were authorized only for tank crews. These look very different from all other boots, so he didn't even make it all the way to formation before our First Sergeant saw him headed to his platoon and jumped his shit. Sadly for this second Private, we were still designated a lowly ADA unit and not an armor unit. We had no tanks. Our APCs and Vulcans don’t count as “armor” in that sense. The Tanker boots were tall and expensive. He got them because he thought “they looked cool.” Maybe he also thought the M163 Vulcan counted as a tank. Obviously HIS headspace and timing was also off. Again, our First Sergeant helpfully pointed out AR 670-1, and because PVT Y was around the day before for the debacle with PVT X and the Jump Boots, he got smoked twice as bad. Well, he also got smoked twice as bad because Top was a dick. Again, this poor kid wasted money he didn’t have a lot of on boots he couldn’t return and never could wear. Tanker boots were really expensive too, especially when your monthly salary as an E2 is $750.

A few months later, we got four new privates from AIT for the Vulcan platoons for some guys who rotated out. I saw them get dropped off from AIT shortly after our morning PT was over. A little nervous and excited, lined up with their duffel bags outside the platoon offices, getting assignments and room keys. They were all in proper uniform at the time. 

Afternoon formation rolls around. Again, ""No shit, there I was."" At least it was months later and not 48 hours after the first incident. Their headspace and timing was really off, because they all fell out for their first battery formation wearing Jump boots on their first fucking day at the unit. Same thing – they heard after they got their orders that 11th ADA was attached to XVIII Airborne Corps, and they just figured they were allowed to wear them. They didn't remember their AR 670-1 training, and they didn't wait to ask someone at their new unit if they could wear them. Queue a repeat – yelling, smoking, accusations of their headspace and timing being off. 

I’m shocked they didn’t fall out wearing Airborne berets too. 

What's really funny about those last four - even if they were graduated, they were still technically in the care of AIT when they were taken to the clothing store before they reported to us on the van from AIT. So there was an NCO with them when they purchased those Jump Boots. That shouldn't have happened to begin with. That's how four guys showed up on Day 1 with them on. Then again, maybe that NCO let them do it and had a silent chuckle as he saw them do it. Kind of a shitty thing to do to a new soldier if so. Maybe he stayed outside and didn't notice. Certainly the civilian clerks will sell whatever to whoever - they aren't there to check your MOS and the regs.

Headspace and timing is a difficult thing for some folks. Having it “off” isn’t nearly as catastrophic as a .50 blowing up in your face, but it also isn’t any fun either when everyone knows it is off but you. That's why we (usually) point it out to each other.

But I always wondered - was there someone up in 6th Training Brigade fucking with us by telling all these new soldiers they were going to an ""Airborne unit?""","2903"

&amp;#x200B;

 *I’m French. I’m in the Army. I’m in the infantry and fucking proud of it. I do love embracing the suck and I always took everything with that « fuck it » mindset.*

As a kid I always played the little soldier. Before my 10th birthday I had watched Band of Brothers several times and I was reenacting all my favorite scene in my backyard. I dreamed about running under fire, jumping through grenade explosions, yelling orders and fire my gun like a real badass.

Another day doing motorized patrols. Maybe we will find another weapons cache or a Toyota pick up truck fully buried in the sand. Who fucking cares, always the same. I don't know how many radio reports I've heard saying we found dozens of AK-47 Type 81 Chinese version with full magazines, RPG-7 rockets, 82mm mortars, various rockets ready to become IEDs. I'm bored senseless. 

I'm replacing the gunner for a few hours, so I have a M240 in my right hand. I feel the sweat in my combat gloves. I feel it drip under my helmet. I feel the hot wind drying my face and lips, I feel the sand assaulting my corneas. My vehicle is third in the column. Fuck, I pick up all the sand from the vehicles up front. Life sucks. I am thirsty but I don't want to drink warm plastic water with sand in my face... Guess i'll wait.

Finally ! We are rerouted to a village where civilians reported that a GAT (Armed Terrorists Group) visited early this morning. We have to gather intel and secure the area if need be. 

The desert is without end. Full of sand, full of dark rocks, full of small dry bushes. We make a real storm of sand and dust on our way to our new mission. I feel excited to get close to my enemy. 

The column slow down and I understand that the drivers received orders to get into a line. A line facing the village. Our mission. 

I check my 240, it's ready to fire. I have my binoculars and I look at the village just after the dust settles. We all slow down instinctively waiting for enemy contact or an assault order. 

\- *""We got movement east of the village. Male""* 

I tense on my 240. I scan the horizon and I'm frustrated because I have no visual. Only fucking small wooden and clay houses. Those little bushes block my view. Something isn't right. 

My suspicions are confirmed by a senior sergeant we have with us : 

\- *""There's something wrong boys. There's no one in that fucking village. Not even a donkey. Get ready. You, get down the turret. Gunner take back your 240. Quickly !""*

I hear the stress in his voice and it gives me a chill. I get down the turret and take my HK416 and make sure it's good to go. I need a smoke. I'm thirsty. 

I feel the small rocks under our tires and the slow pace we have. 

\- *""All unit halt !!""*

I'm thrown on the passenger seat. We stopped abruptly. I only hear the idle engine and the questions on the comms as to why the fuck we stopped. We have to continue on foot. This whole empty village spooked our CO. I feel it in its voice. They disembark us 50m from the main road and the vehicle go on our left to cover our advance. Ready to light up this small village. 

We form a line and we walk with our guns up to this village. We have maybe 100m to walk. I feel warm, cold, afraid and excited. 

I see movement behind a small wooden cabin. I yell and I'm quickly followed by my brothers who saw it too. We go faster. We have absolutely no cover. If shit goes down we are fucked. Closing on the village we adopt a column from both sides of the road to secure every small cabin. 

I'm first on the right column. My gun is pointed right at the door entrance of the cabin 20 meters in front of me. I wait for the small push to go forward. My buddy behind me squeeze my shoulder and we go. We walk fast. We are mean. This turn to CQB quickly and we rehearsed this everyday for months. Violence of action is the way to go. Both my eyes are opens and I see my red dot dancing in front of my right eye, fixed on this dark door frame. At almost 5 meters from it my buddy push me faster as to go fast and strong into the cabin. I don't even have time to think about the risk. Could have a guy just prone in the shadow ready to unleash full auto on my motivated face. Fuck it. 

We storm, I light up my surefire on strobe and scan the small room. It's dark, dusty and almost moist. I smell iron on my tongue. I stop the strobe and I see them. 

I see them. 

Kids. Young kids. Laying in the dirt in their own blood. All tangle up in a grotesque way. I remember the cuts on their bodies. Their hands and feet cut off. 

I just stare. I take it all in. The smell is unbearable. Kids butchered and left in a dark hot cabin. I stare. I take in all the details. Putain.

Meanwhile, the column advanced and my buddy squeeze my shoulder and I just turn around like a robot. I turn off the light. I get back at the end of the column. I am not in the village anymore. I feel like I see myself from 3rd person perspective.

Is that my war ? Is that what I fantasize about since I was kid ? What is wrong with me ? 

I see them. 

The bodies behind the houses. Men, boys and babies. I can't wrap my head around it. I just go forward. 

Village is secure a couple seconds after. Maybe minutes or hours, who cares. 

They left alive the elders. Grandmas and grandpas. Survivors drag their family members to bury them. They killed all the males and took the women and girls. Sex and human trafficking is business for those motherfuckers.

How am I supposed to gather intel from a grandma that has to bury her grand kid that has been nailed to a wooden door. If there is a God, I hate him. 

We give them our water. They poisoned the well by throwing children in there. 

I am not able to do my job. I froze and had to deal with all of this. All this training to kill and not be able to handle death. They sent me overseas with a gun and the ability to use it efficiently and yet I'm just a young guy in his twenties confronted to the real hard world.

I puked behind the well. I cried silently behind my ballistic glasses. I light a smoke. I look up to the blue sky. There are a few strands of white clouds casting shadows here and there. I see the birds circling the village. 

I see them.","2972"
"102","On his last day in the unit I did it in front of the entire company on parade, only instead of a banana I pulled out a scroll and read off it a list of accomplishments while serving with us, all the good stuff he'd done for our soldier's etc. Generally bigged him up and showed him some love. 

Then I gave him a banana! 🤣🤣🤣","3023"

"104","May 1991- The welcome home parade thrown for us by the island of Oahu after Desert Storm was incredible and surreal all in the same pacific breath. People were cheering proudly with tears in their eyes. A lady ran out to our vehicle and offered her daughter as a bride. We were young and nothing could stop us.  I waved passionately at every shouting face I could see. In the very back of my mind, behind every joyous shout, was a small memory that curiously passed through my mind like the bite from a burning spark. We were on our way back to Saudi Arabia from the Kuwait Airport when our convoy stopped next to a tank that had been blown open like an aluminum can chewed up by a lawnmower. We jumped off the truck and explored the tank as if it were a museum piece. As soon as I looked into a massive hole on the front apron of the tank I was greeted by two burned boots tucked under the drivers seat, a yellow bone visible inside the black hole of one of the boots. The young guy in the parade had no idea that those boots would be hiding behind every closed door.","3041"
"105","I'm sitting here on winter break from school and working my way through a bottle of Jack Daniel's ""Winterjack"" as I write this, listening to some (not country) music and feeling nostalgic. I got to thinking about some guys.

I’ve titled this piece “Country Roads” because every time I think of these two guys, for some reason that song, “Take me Home, Country Roads” by John Denver pops in my head. Not that I’m a huge country music fan, but I do like this song:

&gt;Almost heaven, West Virginia

&gt;Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River

&gt;Life is old there, older than the trees

&gt;Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze

&gt;Country roads, take me home

&gt;To the place I belong

&gt;West Virginia, mountain mama

&gt;Take me home, country roads


In the Army, you either had a Platoon Sergeant or a Platoon Daddy. To my mind, a Platoon Sergeant was the NCO in charge who took care of you. The Platoon Daddies had the same job. The difference is, Platoon Sergeants saw it as something they had to do – a duty for their position. Platoon Daddies genuinely cared about you, and would go above and beyond. They worked hard to make sure you were squared away, that you got promoted, your leave was approved, your pay was straightened out – etc. You love your Platoon Daddy – you *might* be willing to say “Good Morning, Sergeant” to your Platoon Sergeant. Because he wouldn't fight for you as much, or just tell you to go to battalion and sort your own issues.

The best Daddy I had in the Army was from West Virginia. From an earlier story:

&gt;I can't remember his name, but I remember him. He was from West Virginia. He liked to say he was from so far up in the mountains that they had to truck in daylight. He had lost most of that accent, but when he got mad, it came out. And it was HEAVY. Like he was speaking a foreign language heavy. So he would get mad and be screaming at us for something, we wouldn't understand, and we would laugh. Then he would get mad, turn purple, and yell some more. Every single time he tried to chew out the platoon, it ended with every one of us on the ground, crying and holding our sides while we laughed hysterically until he said something that sounded like ""FRAAZCHNELSATC!"" and stalked off. Every. Single. Time. He really was a good guy though. We gave him shit, but we loved him. He cared for his guys.

SFC X is what we will call him. We loved this guy so much we sometimes just said, “Hey Daddy – I have a question” or “Daddy, I need help.” It was silly and immature and we always laughed about it, but it was a way to show him that you appreciated what he did for you.

Fast forward. 

I’m back at Ft. Bliss after Desert Storm. I’ve been slapped with the P4 profile – which means I am permanently disabled and the Army is going to medically discharge me. I’m up at William Beaumont Army Hospital for a physical. As I’m walking out, I come around a corner and bump into SFC X. 

Turns out he left Korea, but couldn’t leave until after Desert Storm was over due to the stop-loss orders that were issued service-wide. So he was mad that he missed the fighting. We talked about my deployment a bit and then turned to him. He had some kind of medical issue – his back or his knees I think – and he was being medically retired after nearly 20 years in the service. He was happy as hell, and looked VERY relaxed. He loved us, but I think the stress of taking care of soldiers was getting to him. He kind of reminds me of some teachers I work with today. Good people, but they have been doing it too long and need to retire. 

But I wasn’t done with my peeps from West Virginia yet. Let’s flash back to Korea. 

I knew this guy (we will call him SPC Y) casually in another platoon. He was an E4 and a gunner on a Vulcan. Nice guy, good soldier, worked hard. He ETS'd out of Korea before I did. I didn't see him again until after Desert Storm. He was assigned to a different battery in our battalion. Since I was on my P4 profile, I was having trouble doing traditional PT, so I was over at the gym and ran into him. He had been put in charge of the boxing tournament that was coming up. I ended up fighting in it. He was Golden Gloves in West Virginia before he joined the Army, so he knew his shit.

I've mentioned before somewhere that I was horribly bullied as a kid. Tall, gangly, red hair, braces for a lot of my youth, etc. I got not only verbal abuse, but plenty of physical as well. Kids are mean little fuckers when they want to be. I got beat up a lot and never learned how to fight properly. 

So I joined the tournament. I trained with SPC Y when he had time.  I told him my story, about why I was doing it. The little guys were too fast, but I can take a punch. So soon I'm putting down thousands of calories a day and working out a lot to try and build mass. I gain enough weight to move up to heavyweight, at his suggestion.

The fight night came. I got matched to a guy who I could tell immediately was pretty skilled. The fight got called in the first minute. He got a good punch in to the eye, and I had what they call a ""mouse"" - a huge blood blister forming under it. I wanted to fight. He wanted to fight. But the ref wasn't willing to let anyone get hurt. I mean, I get it, protect the soldiers and all that, but I was there to fight and so was he. People get hurt. People get knocked out. Calling a TKO for a routine injury that a lot of boxers suffer is bullshit. We could have kept going - I could see just fine. Worst case scenario, it pops and I bleed in spectacular fashion.

Nope. TKO. Fuck. We hugged it out and both bitched about the fact the zebra wouldn't let us finish.

Loss or not, I’ll be forever grateful to SPC Y. This cat gave me the confidence to stand and just bang with someone, even if it wasn't for long. I’ve since lost that fear. I've done a little more fighting over the years, although that is now behind me. I still can’t fight very well, but I am no longer afraid. Losing that fear made me realize what a burden it had been.

I’ve never been to West Virginia, even though I’ve been to 38 of the 50 US states. I’ll need to go sometime. If those two are any indication of how amazing people from that state are, visiting those country roads will be well worth the visit.

"106","&gt; Start today. I'm with you on that. Coal needs to die.

Coal is *basically dead already,* that's the thing. Like, not ***even*** from a tree-hugging hippie ""let's not turn the planet into an ecological disaster"" point of view (though, absolutely from that PoV), coal *is dead.* The reason the mines were all dying out is because fucking electrification of the factories happened about *fifty years before then,* and Dieselization of the railroads was happening to the railroads that hadn't electrified. (and would, ultimately, happen to most of them that *did* anyway, RAZZEN FRAZZEN, GODDAMNIT MILWAUKEE ROAD, YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE!)

Hell, Dieselization of the railroads probably would've happened *sooner* than it did (it started in the late '30s, but ended in like, the '70s) had World War II not required *every piece of rolling stock that could be put in service in a big damn hurry* leaving all those coal-rollers in good shape at the end with like, twenty or thirty years of good service life left in them. (Hah! I did manage to work a military point on-topic.)

Grandpa wasn't an ecologically-minded guy by any stretch, he left coal country because he could see that the *demand* for coal was nose-diving, and consequently, so was the demand for coal-miners.

Sloppy: Well there is more than one, but Parker and I vividly relived following saga.

Dear Reader: Feels like a Miracle on 34TH Street! 

Sloppy: Indeed. Much better than a Miracle on Route Irish!

Dear Reader: (Puzzled) “Miracle on Route Irish?” What’s that?

Sloppy: Ensuring you have all your digits after you unexpectedly, and unwillingly, participate in an IED (Improvised Explosive Device/Roadside Bomb).

Dear Reader: Yea-yea, about Hawk!?!

Hollywood and the video game industry grossly misrepresent combat and the Special Operations Forces (SOF) community. Combat is ninety percent extreme boredom and only ten percent adrenaline-pumping lead jellybean exchange. Furthermore, there is absolutely no respawning. 

Dear Reader: How do you cope with the extreme boredom?

Sloppy: Fuckery!

Combat was less technologically sophisticated in the early days. Soldiers lacked the ability to call or email at our leisure. We heavily relied on letter and package-mail. My father was like clockwork, and I could expect a replenishment of carboard Copenhagen every three weeks. The mail was akin to the lottery for some Soldiers. Always willing to play, but rarely winning. Meanwhile, some Soldiers received enough mail to make you jealous. Brady, Fucking Brady!

Brady received enough mail to make you sick. We were a nation at war! Possibly **not** coming home was an unpleasant occupational reality. Still, Brady received entirely too much mail. I am not saying I never partook in the devourment of homecooked bakery goods, but Brady was deployed to Iraq, not terminally ill. Sam, Brady’s wife, clearly missed her husband. So much so, it was literally on display. 

Sam frequently sent risqué photos to Brady, and Brady would display them on the front of his janky metal locker. Sam had started working at Hooters shortly prior to our combat deployment. 

Dear Reader: “Hooters?”

Sloppy: Yes. 

Dear Reader: What the fuck is “Hooters?”

Sloppy: It’s “Delightfully tacky. Yet unrefined!”

Dear Reader: What does that mean?

Sloppy: It’s a restaurant Dear Reader. They specialize in buffalo chicken wings, bar-fare, and scantily-clad women with healthy bosoms 

Dear Reader: Oh!?!

Sloppy: Yeah, Sam got a pair of bolt-ons prior to our deployment.

Dear Reader: Bolt-ons?

Sloppy: An “accessory that can be bolted on or otherwise attached.”

Dear Reader: I still don’t…

Sloppy: Sam’s “Bolt-Ons” were new silicone sweater-stretchers.

Dear Reader: Silicone…

Sloppy: Tits. Sam purchased new tit.

Dear Reader: (Epiphany) **OH!!!** Yup. I get it know.

Sam really enjoyed showing off her new additions. So did Brady. 

One of the unfortunate realities of combat deployments is Guard Duty. We secured ourselves in the early days. I vividly recall staring out into nothingness for hours and hours until replacement arrived. Dear Reader, I **OFTEN** prayed the enemy would mount an offensive attack, because Guard Duty was that uneventful. There was almost nothing you could do to make the experience more joyful. Three of the four towers were manned by two Soldiers. 

**INCOMING: TANGENT**

Tower guard was a four-hour duty, but your perception of time was largely dependent on the other Soldier. Spending four-hours in a tower with your brother-from-another-mother can be pleasant. I have had many of thought-provoking conversations with Blake (Best Friend). 

Blake: If you could sleep with anyone in the world, who would it be?

Sloppy: Anyone?

Blake: **Anyone!**

Sloppy: Jennifer Anniston or Julie Roberts.

Blake: Really? 

Sloppy: Yeah. I prefer the wholesome type. 

**SIDE NOTE:** The production of “One Night in Paris” had just been bootlegged.

Blake: Oh. I figured you would say Paris Hilton or…

Sloppy: I said “wholesome” not “whore.” 

Blake: Okay. Your mother is in one room, and Julia Roberts is in the other room. The fait of humanity rests on your shoulders. You must fuck one and kill the other. What are…

Sloppy: I’m fucking Julia…

Blake: YOU’D KILL YOUR MOM?

Sloppy: Versus **FUCK** her? Ah…yes! Why? Would you…

Blake: **Fuck no!** I’d kill my mom too.

This intensely thought-provoking question would eventually proliferate the entire Platoon. We would also eventually learn there were potential mother fuckers in our ranks. Sure, the fate of humanity was no longer in peril, but how could you even look your mother in the eye anymore? Silly mother fuckers. 

My apologies Dear Reader, back to Brady. Many Soldiers had pictures of their significant others adorning the outside of their lockers. Brady was the only one who willingly put pictures of Sam wearing skimpy lingerie. It really irritated me too. 

I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) prior to joining the Army. Many Soldiers falsely claim to have OCD because they’re organized. This is not my reality though. I count to five, in my head, while opening or closing a Nalgene bottle. I drink in a cadence of five gulps. The stereo volume in my 4Runner is set in increments of five or even numbers. Despite overcoming several compulsions, I will always be an **EXTREME** neat freak.

Dear Reader, I was not bothered with Sam’s “sexy-time” pictures. I questioned why Brady decorated the outside of his locker with said pictures, but the pictures themselves did not offend me. The mental friction-point I could not overcome was how they were haphazardly placed. There was no system or order, and the arrangement was not symmetrical. 

Doctor D, my childhood psychologist, worked tirelessly with me to overcome “other people’s areas.” The disorganization of other people’s areas genuinely bothered me to a fault during my formative years. I finally overcame this during my tenure in the Special Operations Forces (SOF), but I was still wandering towards total resolution during this deployment. Being forced to gaze at Brady’s messy collage drove me to insanity. 

Sloppy: Brady, we need to talk about your locker!

Brady: What’s wrong with my locker? Is it messy Sergeant? 

Sloppy: No! I am talking about the pictures of Sam. Can you just neatly place them in a row, and stop taking them on-and-off?

Brady: (Puzzled) On-and-off? I don’t take them off Sergeant. 

Sloppy: Oh, they move. Everyday a different picture has been moved.

Brady: (More Puzzled) Really? How can you tell?

Sloppy: (Irritated) Please just trust me when I say, “They are moving!”

Brady: (Cautious) Okay, but Sergeant, I swear they are in the same spot they have always been in.

Sloppy: **NO, THEY’RE NOT!**

*Awkward silence* 

*Four Soldiers returning from guard duty enter room*

*More awkward silence*

Parker: (Confused) What’s going on here?

Sloppy: We are discussing why Brady’s pictures keep moving ever so slightly. 

Brady: (Pleading) But they’re not moving Sergeant. 

*Insert Drumroll Noise*

Hawk: Yea, they are. 

Brady: (Flustered) Oh, now you’re some sort of expert on picture placement?

Hawk: (Laughing) No, but I know they are moving! 

Brady: (Angry) **HOW?**

Hawk: (Shit-Eating-Hawk-Grin) I take one or two of them when I am tower one!

Crowd: ***Hysterical Laughter*** 

Again, **three** of the **four** towers were manned by two Soldiers. Tower One was too small and therefore a solo mission. Pulling four-hours of tower guard in Tower One was brutal. I mean, unless you were pulling something else. 

Dear Reader: I don’t get it!?!

Sloppy: Tower One was colloquially referred to as the Jack-Shack!

Dear Reader: (Yucky-Face) **OH!**

*Back to barracks room*

*Hysterical laughter continues to echo*

Sloppy: (Grinning) **FUCK’N KNEW THEY WERE MOVING!!!**

Brady: (Bewildered) **WHAT?!?**

*Brady sits on bed.*

*Places both hands on head.*

*Slow, slow and surreal realization*

Hawk: (Oblivious Smile) Dude, I always put the pictures back dude!

Brady: That…

*Another moment of silence*

Brady: That’s **NOT** the point. You’ve been jacking-off to pictures of my wife Hawk. 

Hawk: (Still Oblivious) Yes, but I **ALWAYS** put the pictures back. 

Brady: (Beside Himself) I don’t even know how I should feel about this!?!

Hawk: (Awkward Consoling) You should feel good that your wife is hot.

*More hysterical laughter. (Not from Brady though)*

Brady: (Stands Up) I’m putting them inside my…

Hawk: NO. Don’t do that!

Brady: I don’t even know which ones you touched…

*Pause*

Brady: This is so fucking gross!

*Brady looks to Sloppy*

Brady: Do you know which ones Sergeant?

Sloppy: YES!

Dear Reader, I had already written a story about finding Hawk “pulling” security. Parker’s call, out-of-the-blue, served to paint a clearer picture. I failed to realize it while writing, but I have a huge grin while I type this out. Our beloved Hawk did the five-knuckle-shuffle with pictures of Sam serving as motivation. Well, isn’t that some funny shit?!?

Dear Reader, I **STRONGLY** encourage you to invade my Post History and read “Hunting a Woodenhead Kid.” It is a relatively short post with hyperlinks to every Hawk story in chronological order. Also, I am not writing this to entice you to read my stories. I am writing this to address anticipate questions. For example…

New Dear Reader: Did Brady kill Hawk?

Sloppy: Nope!

New Dear Reader: Seriously? Was Hawk a physical specimen?

Sloppy: No, Brady was. Hawk is just Hawk. 

New Dear Reader: So why…

Sloppy: Hawk was our Warner (There’s Something about Mary). It’s not PC (Politically Correct) to beat up mental feeble humans.

New Dear Reader: Mentally feeble? And the Army gave him a gun?

Sloppy: Yes, with a grenade launcher.

New Dear Reader: I have **so many questions.**

Sloppy: I know. Read the other stories and I promise it will all make sense. 

Dear Reader, I now have more stories about Hawk. Tis the season for gift giving indeed! I will hold-off on posting the other stories though. They are long and will take a considerable amount of time for me to properly articulate the insanity. I felt an **urgent need** to post this particular saga though. 

Dear Reader: Why?

Sloppy: Parker’s call out-of-the-blue brought another realization. 

Dear Reader: Which is?

Some of us are blessed and fortunate. This time of year, specifically this time of year,  allows us to spend precious time with family and friends. “**Us**” is not all inclusive though. This time of year is an incredible struggle for others. Seriously, would anyone think “tWitch” Boss was suffering? I have a request for you. I implore you to look through your contacts and drop a simple “I was just thinking about you…” or “How you living” text to a fellow veteran. We need to desperately figure out how to decrease the “22 Veterans a Day.” Don’t wait around for an answer, because **YOU** are the answer.

I hope you all have a wonderful Holiday Season and Happy New Year!

Cheers,

Sloppy","3180"
"108","Y'know, there still are people who live in the backwoods with no running water except what's in the stream, nothing that ""flushes."" With luck, everybody does their business in the outhouse, and about once or twice a year... welp, you usually don't clean it up. Just build another outhouse - depends on how many people are using it.

But you have to realize that people in your training class come from all over - some from the shiny suburbs of Colorado Springs. Like everyone else, such people imagine that somewhere else is pretty much like the somewhere they grew up in.

It's all training, right? Here's a Basic Training story I posted on reddit two years ago:

&gt;Basic training in 1966 at the utterly-misnamed Army base, Fort Bliss. Some sixty young men, in two open-bay barracks with the usual lack of privacy - large showers and shitters all lined up along one wall, no partitions.   
&gt;  
&gt;We were a collection of boys from everywhere. The Tejanos ruled the roost, there were white and black boys from Denver and the surrounding ranchlands, and miscellaneous others - one Cuban refugee who was older than any of us, three guys from Ohio who claimed to have been moonshiners before they were drafted, and so on.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Ohio guys exclaimed at the indoor plumbing, pronounced our latrine to be amazingly luxurious, running water and flushing toilets! My suburban world-view was failing me mightily. Where'd all these strange people come from?  
&gt;  
&gt;After a couple of days, the whole platoon started to gel. We were all different, but about the same age, dressed the same, haircut the same and going through the same shit. Got to meet people I would have *never* met (at least on equal terms), got to know them better than a lot of folks back home that were my friends.  
&gt;  
&gt;So it was okay, almost a patriotic good, all of us living together. Then about two weeks in, there were about thirty of us taking a two minute shower all at once, and one of the Drill Sergeants had apparently received a complaint from Quartermaster Laundry.  
&gt;  
&gt;He stuck his head into the steamy shower bay and shouted, ""Y'all be sure to wash your anus!""  
&gt;  
&gt;Wut? There are people here who don't already know to do that? Who? WTF? I was culture-shocked all over again.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then one of the Ohio guys leaned over to me with a worried look. ""What's a *anus*?"" he asked. Oh God.","3182"
"109","People are laughing at the moonshine boy? Whyfor? That he didn't grok Latin? I don't think he was the only one in that shower who had no idea where his ""anus"" was.

I was laughing at *me.* I had been around the world as a service brat, seen ancient ruins, lived nights in Byzantium, interacted with strange people in faraway places... I was a little suburban snob. And I had NO idea.

I should point out that I went through Basic Training during a Pentagon-ordered ramp-up of GI numbers. Vietnam was heating up, and warm bodies needed to get processed through Basic and AIT right away, right now, failure is NOT an option. Everybody gets trained, no one washes out.

In order to go from selection to mass production of soldiers, the Basic NCOs were under orders to be nice to us. Swearing and humiliation were no longer teacher's pet solutions. And apparently, cussing was frowned up. I'm guessing that ""asshole"" was considered cussing by someone with brass. Use a nicer word.

I'm pretty sure that Drill Sergeant only recently learned the Latin for ""asshole."" I'm pretty sure he was instructed to use ""anus"" so as not to offend our delicate sensibilities.","3192"
"110","**Background:**

I was the only Master Chief Petty Officer (E9) and Command Master Chief at Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans during the Hurricane Katrina crisis. I was temporarily assigned as the 2nd Executive Officer (XO) during the emergency responsible for everything on the grounds except the aircraft performing the rescues and support, which were being overlooked by the CO and real XO in 12-hour shifts.  One of my responsibilities was getting someplace for 200 people to live and sleep rather than the current conditions, which was mostly sleeping anywhere that a body could find floor space, or a semi comfortable position in the small Admin Building. On to the story.

**The story** 

During the 2nd week after the storm hit, I was relaxing in my office one evening (a rare event at the time) when one of the 4 Pro's from Dover that had been sent from Miami to build a trailer Park of RV's (fifth wheelers - Trailers that were pulled by larger pick-up trucks) barged into my office in a panic. Now, when they had checked in with me several days earlier, I had told them to build a trailer park they would like to live in and would be proud to have their names attached to. And let me know if they ran into any problems. One of them barging excitedly into my office at this time of night did not bode well. G-R-E-a-t,

He blurted, We got a major problem! I asked What? He rapidly explained that the first 5 trailers were here. I asked, Wasn't that a good thing? He said Yeah, but there was apparently a breakdown in communications somewhere. These trailers are from Houston, TX and once the trucks drop off the trailers, they are heading back to get another 5 trailers. I said Oookaaayyy? He continued, They were told they could refuel here. And they are diesels! I thought SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT! We moved to the trucks.

Let me explain. Most of our support ground equipment (GE) ran on MOGAS (just regular gasoline.) Thus, we had a decent sized tank of MOGAS to keep them running. But we only had one or two pieces of pieces of GE that were diesel, which were supported by one small diesel tank. Definitely not big enough to support 5 diesel pickups AND the GE. I didn't think the optics would be good if the forklifts didn't run due to no gas. So that was out.

I went over to explain the situation to the lead pickup driver. His response was No problem. We'll get gas in town.  I told him that might be a problem since there is no electricity in about a hundred-mile radius, there are no gas stations open. His reply made my heart drop. In that case, YOU have to find us gas. I asked if there were any other options? He looked me square in the eye and said, No. And no more trailers would be coming if they didn't get back. And Oh, by the way, there's 10 more trucks coming. Shit Shit Shit Shit Shit! I said OK let me see what i can do.

I turned around, and low and behold, I figured it out. But I had a problem or to two to overcome to make it work. In front of me sat 5 or 10 (Too long ago, I don't remember exactly how many) large generators, and when I mean large, I mean LARGE! Each came with a HUGE portable tank of gas - diesel gas! These generators were scheduled to be slung by a helicopter to outlying units that were without power. But none had been delivered yet, so I figured I'd have time to replace one tank.

But the problems I faced, that I knew of, was first, I didn't think it was legal to give government gas to a civilian. And second, how do I get it from that huge tank into a truck's gas tank?  Now there's nobody better at figuring out how to get around problems that a Chief Petty Officer in Uncle Sam's Hooligan Navy - AKA, The US Coast Guard. So off I went to see the Chief overlooking the GE.

First thing he said was that due to the tank's weight (\~3500 pounds/1588 Kg's), our small forklifts wouldn't lift it. He continued, And we do have to move it to the small diesel tank and lift it up to gravity feed the small tank while fuel is being dispersed. Shit shit shit shit shit. I went to Plan B and called the Ops Desk and asked the Ops Boss what the possibility of slinging the tank over to the small tank? He immediately shot it down with about a thousand reasons why it wasn't feasible.

I was walking around completely in the dumps and wondering how I was going to fix this or be standing tall explaining the situation to the CO the next morning. Out of nowhere, the chief in charge of GE popped up in front of me wearing the biggest shit eating grin I'd seen in a long time. I blurted Give me some good news. He all but yelled, I found a forklift! I could have kissed him, right there in the middle of the parking lot with a kiss so good Hallmark Movie Channel actors would have been jealous!

Off we went to ""borrow"" a forklift from the Navy Flight Line. If anyone saw the forklift being followed by my *very distinctive* Kart flying a 3'x4' Coast Guard flag driving off the flight line, no one said anything. We started moving the tank and were about 3/4 of the way to where it needed to be when I heard a voice say What are you DOING? 

I spun around and a LT Commander (04) was standing there, hands on hips. I replied moving this to the diesel tank. WHY, Master Chief? I explained the plan to him and why. When he started to say what I was doing was highly illegal, I interrupted him and asked if he was a pilot?   He said Yeah, why? I just replied that I take responsibility for this action, and I believe his place of duty was in Operations, not in the parking lot. I thought One problem at a time. Let me get these trucks out of here and then handle him. To my surprise he walked away towards Operations.

**The aftermath**

We got those damned trucks gassed up and on their way, along with the 25 or so that followed them. All GE was kept running. We returned the Navy's forklift and never heard anything about it. But best of all, those 4 Pro's from Dover built one beautiful trailer park, including housing for all, boardwalks between and to trailers, an air conditioned 4-holer latrine trailer, and 2 trailers that were showers with HOT water! It was outstanding! And if any of you 4 read this, my profound thanks!

And I never heard anything about repurposing 500 gallons of diesel from anyone, nor ran into that LT Commander again.

Bottom line: During a crisis, Ya gotta do what ya gotta do. Thanks for reading! And if I don't get another one out before Christmas, Merry Christmas y'all!","3213"
"111","On the bright side, it is a testament to your humanity and empathy that having witnessed such violence had and has such a strong impact on you.

"112","My apologies for the roughness of the draft.

I thought your ""draft"" was awesome writing! I have tears in my eyes (being a father of four that I claim) and a grandfather after reading. I haven't laughed this hard in a while as it takes me back to when I rubbed shoulders with admirals (none of whom wore only 1 star) and knew what they were like over beers and away from cameras.  

Again, my compliments on your writing. Enjoyed it, and the story, immensely!","3338"
"113","I was reminded of this by a post in a different sub...

This happened before I had become the salty, disgruntled, jaded, retired sailor that I am now, I decided to join the Navy to see the world. (God I was so stupid back then).

Now you need to understand something about the military specifically the Navy and I say ""the Navy"" cuz it could be any country's Navy. The Navy operates, on or in very close proximity to water. This is important boys and girls....things in the Navy are expected to at a minimum at least be able to float, including you.

So swim quals when you first join the Navy are considered extremely important. Back in those days, they were still very restrictive about letting men and women be around each other during training. We had a ""brother company"" that we would do occasional training but that was the rare exception to the rule.

Swim quals are one of the few times we were allowed together. At this time the only thing the US Navy required you to do when you first joined was to be able to tread water and turn your clothes into a floatation device. Basically they just want to make sure if and when you get wet you at least have the ability to float momentarily.

So they want you to jump into the water off a platform (this is not a high platform this is not like a high dive it's literally at the edge of the pool so basically you're just stepping into water) they want you to float and if possible they want you to navigate to the other side of the pool through any means necessary other than drowning.

If you are unable to do that on the first try they take you to the shallow end. They give the recruit one-to-one instruction, and then they have you try again. They were both male and female instructors and it does not matter what sex instructor you have, they are chosen for their swimming ability. This very large young man in my ""brother"" company literally looked like a tank walking at you he was easily 6 and 1/2 ft tall and he was one solid mass of muscle (his biceps had biceps). He did not make it through on the first try. They had him in the shallow end for a while working with him it was time for him to try again. He gets up on the platform, and the instructor in the water to assist is a woman.

He refuses to step off the platform into the water he is being cajoled (actually in a pretty nice way looking back on it) by the instructor in the water as well as the instructors on the platform to get in the water. He's not having it. He's told if he does not pass swim quality he's going to be separated from the military at that point he looks at them and says he wants a male instructor in the water with him. He becomes quite emphatic about it.

My female drill instructor assigned to my company (just made the height requirement to join the military at the time to say you could have picked her up and put her in your pocket is not a joke) was a teeny tiny, skinny, meaner than hell woman when provoked. She has been sitting quietly-ish (for drill instructors) on the bleachers near the pool edge, waiting for all the people to finish quals.

She hears this jackass ask/demand a female instructor in the water and loses her damn mind. She jumps up and starts running towards him screaming at the top of her lungs at him. This 6 1/2 ft tall rock wall took one look at this woman and with what can only be described as a sheer look of terror on his face as she's charging at him stepped off the platform into the water.

In his fear and panic, he starts floundering in the water and the female instructor in the water ends up pulling him out. He is lying on the side of the pool He's trying to cough up every internal organ he has.

I want you to picture a cartoon character who's running in mid-air as fast as they can because that's basically what my female DI was doing. A male instructor has locked up under her armpits just high enough to get her feet off the ground, and she is moving her body with every ounce of strength she has trying to get at this kid lying on the ground. All the while screaming at him that woman just saved your life boy. You wanted a male instructor and that F E M A L E just saved your life what do you have to say for yourself now dumb ass.

Meanwhile, the rest of us are dying laughing and getting screamed at by other drill instructors to shut up.

At that moment, while continuing to flail her body to get to this poor male recruit laying on the ground she manages to kick the DI holding her off the ground square in the balls. They both collapse to the ground the male instructor screams in pain My female instructor now slightly muffled voice (from getting smushed by the male instructor) continues to scream at ""the woman-hater"" recruit.

At that point, the rest of the instructors joined us on the ground in hysterics. For the rest of the time, we were in boot camp whenever we saw our ""brother company"" our female instructor would scream out at the top of her lungs ""Drop Woman-hater, drop""

Having her do this to him was always humorous. Having her doing it to him while they were doing marching practice and everyone was trying to step over or around him while he suddenly has fallen over to the ground in the middle of the formation remains one of my fondest bootcamp memories.","3379"
"114","After I retired I landed a civilian job with the CG. The department I was working with entailed mostly officers and very few enlisted and on top of that, the officers worked mostly alone. Now keep in mind we were the HQ's for this whole department, sort of. Admirals would visit every so often. Invariably, I knew most of them, a lot of them since they were 18 years old. 

When they visited, I would often get a bear hug and jokes would fly. One day, a LT came to me and asked point blank: What's the big deal about being a Master Chief? How the hell do you answer that?","3444"

Dear Reader, I have worked with Green. I have worked with Blue. I have worked with Orange. I also worked in an organization where all the colored organizations melded together to create one. Whiskey, Weights, and War was the battle cry from these barrel-chested freedom-fighters. Everyone began their journey as a “Candidate”, and everyone attended Assessment and Selection. Everyone was “special”, but nobody was more beloved or special than Barb. Barb was our “Travel Princess!”

Dear Reader: Travel Princess?

Sloppy: Yes!

Dear Reader: What the fuck is a Travel Princess?

Sloppy: Barb was a Defense Travel System (DTS) wizard…

Dear Reader: I thought she was a “Travel Princess?”

Sloppy: Get your shit together! Barb was the Travel Princess **because** she was a DTS Wizard.

Dear Reader: What’s DTS?

Sloppy: It is an archaic computer system the entire Department of Defense (DoD) uses for Travel, Lodging, and Per Diem.

DTS is typically easy to navigate when traveling CONUS (Continental United States). Travel Outside the United States (OCONUS) can by tricky though. There are a considerable amount of gremlins that reside within DTS and they are looking to fucking screw you out of money. Bottom Line – Barb rectifies any errors and ensure creditors are not hunting us down while hunting others on combat deployment.

Dear Reader, some records will never be broken. Shridhar Chillal of Pune, India, did not cut his fingernails for sixty-six years. Just before cutting them, they measured **29 feet, 10 inches** in length. Shridhar could literally tickle your taint from across the room. I sincerely doubt this record will ever be outdone, nor will Barb’s last gift.

Dear Reader, although it was an unwritten rule, it was highly customary to get Barb a gift while deployed OCONUS. Each Squadron would return from their geographically assigned region and shower Barb with trinkets and gifts. The other unwritten rule was to outdo our sister Squadrons in **EVERYTHING**! Especially gift giving.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gift One – Amman, Jordan**

Dear Reader, I love to procrastinate. “If you wait until the last minute, it only takes a minute” is my motto in life. However, there are exceptions. Finding the perfect gift for Barb was always on the forefront of my mind while deployed. Situational Awareness (SA) was crucial. Quick (Teammate) and I had just departed the Intercontinental Hotel and Resort. We were drunkenly walking down Zahran Street when something caught my eye.

Sloppy: (Pointing) Stop! Look!

Quick: At what?

Sloppy: (Still Pointing) **That!**

Quick: (Irritated) **FUCK!!!** I’m too drunk and I see **FOUR** of **THAT!**

Sloppy: The Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Quick: And?

Sloppy: It’s the God Damn Embassy of Iran. Iran QUICK. It’s fucking **IRAN!**

Quick: (Uninterested) Do whatever you want man, I’m walking home!

Sloppy: Well then fuck you then, but I’m getting Barb a gift!

*Quick quickly turns around!*

Quick: **GENIUS!!!**

Dear Reader, please understand The Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran is in fact, Iran. The beautiful landscape which surrounds this particular patch of Iran is a wonderful, and progressive Islamic society. Scaling the wall was only a momentary option because I recalled an old proverb, “There are no Walmart’s in Iran, only Target’s. Quick was a bit more inebriated but feeling resilient.

Quick: Dude boost me over this wall!

Sloppy: Ah…maybe we scout it out first?

Quick: Dude, it’s an in-and-out mission. Just watch my back!

Sloppy: (Sarcastically) Yeah, I CANNOT WAIT TO WATCH THE **GENDARMERIE** SHOOT YOU IN THE BACK!

Quick: Well then shoot them first.

Sloppy: (More Sarcastically) Yeah, great idea. “Here’s your gift Barb. I had to expire two innocent Jordanians, but I hope you like it!

Dear Reader, picture two heavily drunken idiots plotting to invade a parcel of Iran. We had Zahran Street to ourselves, but our “Soup-to-Nuts” planning was severely flawed. We were sloppy drunk and loud as fuck. You can only argue outside an embassy for so long before you draw the attention of the Gendarmerie.

GEN: (Broken English) What you doing?

Sloppy Brain: Think quick!!!

Sloppy: Shopping for a gift!

GEN: No gift here. You go. Go!

Quick: There isn’t a gift shop in the embassy?

GEN: NO! NO GIFT SHOP. **GO!**

*Sloppy admits defeat and starts walking away!*

*Sloppy stops*

*Sloppy sees a plate, hanging on the wall inside the Iranian Embassy!*

*Sloppy mentally transforms from Sloppy-Sloppy to Super Sober Sloppy.*

Sloppy: What about that plate there on the wall?

GEN: (Angry) **NO. CAN’T HAVE!**

Sloppy: Ten JD (Jordanian Dinar)?

GEN: **NO!**

Sloppy: Twenty JD?

*GEN wheels turning!*

GEN: No…

Sloppy: Fifty JD. Final offer?!?

GEN: Wait here!

&amp;#x200B;

**Fast-Forward: Gift Giving Day**

*Here you go Barb!*

Barb: Wow, what a beautiful plate. Did you get it at one of the bazars?

Sloppy: Nope! We got it from the Iranian Embassy in Amman.

Barb: (Shocked) WHAT?

Quick: Yeah, you should probably wear a burka when you hold it, but you’re cool with us Barb!

Barb: Well, I am honored. This is, without a doubt, the coolest gift I have ever received!

Sloppy Brain: Well fuck my tits!

Dear Reader, we had just created a conundrum! How are we going to outdo a mosaic plate from The Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran? Well, I will tell you how if you desire to read another short story. I mean, you’re not obligated. You can quit right here and move along, or you can see how two Army idiots outmaneuvered Murphy’s Law.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gift Two – Lebanon**

Lebanon is, by far, my favorite country in the flying blueberry. So much so, that I honestly plan on retiring there. I could write about Lebanon all day, but you’re not here for a history tour, we are here to discuss gift two.

Lebanon was War, Weights, and Whiskey. Lots of whiskey. My partner and I frequented the local beach bars in our community. It was typically a mix of drinks, business, and pleasure. I quickly decided Colonel Brewery was my favorite dive. However, I had a different teammate this deployment, and we would occasional venture farther, and farther from “home.”

James: (Irritated) Nope, nope, you missed the turn.

Sloppy: No worries, there is a turnaround in a couple hundred meters.

*Sloppy turning*

*Turn is getting tighter*

*Dead-Fucking-Stop*

James: Well would ya look at that!

Dear Reader, we found ourselves looking at a gigantic street sign. We were on El Barbara Street, in Beit El Barbara, Lebanon.

James: (Excited) This bitch has a town named after here, an entire fucking town. Let’s get it.

*Landcruiser door starts to open*

Sloppy: How about we get it later tonight? Like, when it’s dark outside?

James: What, when we’re shit-housed? (Sarcasm) Sounds like a totally logical idea. Two drunken idiots with a Gerber (Multi-Tool) conducting midnight-acquisitions? Yup. Sounds good to me.

Dear Reader, I would like to say we used the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP) to adequately prepare for our covert operation, but we didn’t. We drank the day away until curfew-time arrived. The plan we developed was simplistic at best.

**Side Note:** I just noticed a growing trend. Alcohol, with a dash of stupidity, equates to success. Keep that in mind younger generation!

*We arrived at the giant road sign (60in/152cm)*

*Grab the Gerber*

*Got to work*

Dear Reader, it was a disaster. We had only one Gerber, and our operations was akin to square-peg and round-hole. We lacked the necessary equipment to keep the bolt from free spinning. Our fingers were bloody, and clearly not capable of applying the necessary mechanical force. I was, again, willing to accept defeat.

Dear Reader: I am sorry, but I am still hung-up on your desire to retire in Lebanon. What’s up with that?

Sloppy: The History! The landscape. The food! The relaxing lifestyle. The People!

Dear Reader: The People? Like the ones that bombed the…

Sloppy: **NO!** Not those people. The overwhelming majority of people are hospital and will do anything to help fellowman. Not the politicians either. I am talking about Joe Lebanese.

Dear Reader: Are the people really that nice?

James and I were startled when a beatdown Hilux approached with only one headlight. The older gentlemen got out and introduced himself as Christopher LAST NAME I CANNOT PRONOUNCE. James and I were caught red-handed.

Christopher: Is your car broken down?

James: No. We were…

*Awkward silence*

James: (Defeated) Screw it, we were trying to barrow this sign.

Christopher: (Laughing) Barrow?

James: Look, we know a lady named Barbara, and this would be a perfect gift for her.

Dear Reader, Christopher asked no more questions, as he retrieved a wrench from his truck. A random Lebanese civilian aided our midnight acquisitions. He also helped us jimmy the gigantic sign inside the Landcruiser.

James: Wow! I really appreciate your help.

Christopher: (Laughing) No problem my friend. Think they will miss the sign?

*Christopher walking away*

Christopher: **It’s not missing! Everyone knows it’s Barbara Street!**

&amp;#x200B;

**Fast-Forward: Gift Giving Day**

*Here you go Barb*

Barbara: What the fuck is that?

James: Unwrap it and find out!

*Barb unwraps her gift*

*Eyes light up*

Barbara: O-M-G. It’s my name in English and Arabic.

James: Yeah, turns out you have a town and street named in your honor. But in Lebanon!

Barbara: Where am I going to hang this?

Sloppy: The nameplate on your desk is too small. I think it should go behind your desk, on the wall, so EVERYONE KNOWS what Squadron is king.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gift Three – Lebanon**

*Same country, different deployment*

Again, the people are wonderful! James and I were invited to a bar-b-cue (BBQ). Brigadier General (BG) Jihad invited James and I to meet his extended family deep in the mountains. The journey was outside our “Safe Bubble,” but BG Jihad coordinated for armed escorts, and our request was approved. The entire journey took three hours. James and I had lots of time to ponder what a Lebanese BBQ in the mountains entails.

James: You don’t think he is gonna kill us do you? I mean, you know the guy, right?

Sloppy: I have known the man for four years now, I’d hope not.

James: So…definitely not going to kill us?

Sloppy: I have been to his kids First Communion, and Sunday dinners at his house. We may be having an awkward roadside Lebanese BBQ, but I know we are not getting murdered. Well, I know I am good. Not sure about you, but I suppose we will find out.

*Round a corner*

James: Holy Shit!

Dear Reader, there was no less than sixty people, and they were all having the time of their lives. Four generations of Jihad’s living the Lebanese Dream. Fresh mountain water was dropped in our many glasses of Arak. We met the most interesting individuals, broke bread, and instantly felt as if we were family.

James: So what’s your story?

Human: Hello, my name is Charbel, and Jihad is my uncle!

James: Cool. Are you Army?

Charbel: (Laughing) Not with these hands! I am a beautician.

Jihad: Charbel just arrived back from Paris. He styles celebrity hair, goes to Milan. You know, hair guy!?! A blow dryer is his gun!

*More drinking*

*Shooting clay pigeons*

*More drinking*

*More family arrives*

*Jihad introduces Michael*

Jihad: He is not Army either.

Michael: Pleasure to meet you all!

Dear Reader, there was little talking. Michael was immediately interested in our firearms. The Jihad Clan had pistols and shotguns only. We had custom assault rifles, pistols galore, and a Mk 11 Mod 0 semi-automatic sniper rifle. We setup steel “dingers” from 400-800 meters so Michael could live his fantasy of being a “Sniper.”

*Hours later*

Michael: If there is anything I can do for you, please let me know!

James: No problem brother. Happy you had fun!

Michael: (Dad Joke) Fun? It was a BLAST!

Sloppy: What do you do for a living?

Michael: Import and exports to the United States.

**Fast-Forward: Weeks Later**

Dear Reader, we are on the highway to-and-from Beirut every single day. I know exactly where we are always. There are many landmarks along our route, and I had always wanted to stop at one shop in particular.

*Pull off road*

*Vehicle stops*

James: What the fuck are we doing here?

Sloppy: It’s a statue shop.

James: Yeah, I can see that…

James: Oh…I gotcha!

Owner: Hello! Hello! Come! Come!

James: I am looking for a statue good Sir.

Owner: One in particular?

Sloppy: Saint Barbara

Owner: Oh. Come! I have two.

Dear Reader, the statue was beautiful. Saint Barbara had a crown. Saint Barbara had a sword. Saint Barbara also had the goblet from *Monty Python and the Holy Grail.* She lacked the necessary size to make a statement though.  It was only two feet (60cm). The statue we were looking needed to have a commanding presence.

Dear Reader: Why?

Sloppy: Barbara was nearing retirement. This was our last excursion with Barb being our Travel Princess.

Dear Reader: I see!

*Back to the Statue Shop*

Sloppy: Where is number two?

Owner: Come. Come.

James and I walked outside. We waded through statue after statue, and they were starting to really gain in “wow-size!”

Owner: (Pointing) **HERE!**

James: Jesus…

Owner: No!!! Barbara!

James: Well, that was fun. But that shit ain’t gonna fit in the car!

*Sloppy dials 8675309*

*Ring. Ring. Ring.*

Jenny: Hello!

Sloppy: Hey Jenny, I need to speak with Michael!

*Sloppy speaks with Michael!*

*James mumbles curse words and begs for lunch*

James: (Hangry) We leaving or what?

Sloppy: No, we…

James: **SHIT AIN’T FITTING IN THE CAR BRO!**

Sloppy: Michael will be in twenty minutes.

James: Michael? Which Michael?

Sloppy: “Import and Export to the United States” Michael!

James: You rat bastard!!! Hashtag **WINNING!**

Dear Reader, Michael was a godsend! Michael was able to talk the Owner down a couple thousand dollars, and James and I put our Per Diem money to something other than giggle juice. We agreed on six million Lebanese Lira (LL) which amounts to four thousand US dollars. Spending money had never felt so right.

Michael: My people will load it up tomorrow, and I will have it shipped this week!

Sloppy: Awesome. What do we owe you and when will it arrive?

Michael: It is my pleasure my friend. It will arrive on DATE.

James: So, about two-weeks after us! NOICE!

**Fast-Forward: Gift Day**

*Here you go Barbara!*

Barbara: How very kind of you to support my habit!

James: Supposedly the best vineyard in all of Lebanon.

Barbara: You guys had me wondering! I was worried you would end up in jail. Really glad you decided to not outdo yourselves again.

James: Again, best vineyard in all of Lebanon!

Sloppy: We’re on the straight and narrow pretty lady.

*We depart as the typical dudes who buy the typical gifts!*

**No-Shit (Which means it’s true) – Two Weeks Later**

*Sloppy arrive at work!*

*EVERYONE…*

Troop Commander: You’re supposed to go see Barb.

Troop Sergeant Major: Think your DTS is fucked up! Barb called for James and you!

Operations Sergeant Major: Go see Barb.

*James finally arrives!*

Sloppy: We are supposed to “go see Barb.”

James: (Laughing) I was already told in the parking lot. Wanted to get you first.

Sloppy: THIS. IS. GOING. TO. BE. AWESOME.

*Badge-in*

*Walk to Barbs office*

*Other people are there*

*Barb is crying*

Sloppy Brain: This is bad.

Sloppy Brain: Does Barb have cats? Maybe one died?

*Continue past people into her office*

Sloppy Brain: Maybe we should turn around.

Barb: **YOU TWO. YOU!!! TWO!!!**

*Barb moves in for the hugs!*

Barb: That is the coolest gift **EVER!**

Not only was there a large crowd in Barb’s office, but they had gathered for the big reveal. Nobody had any idea about what was going on, other than somebody made Barb cry.

Crowd: So, what did they get you!

Barb: A STATUE!

Crowd: Where is it?

Barb: I left it at my house!

*Disappointment permeates the air*

*Barb turns giant computer screen monitor*

Mostly Everyone: HOLY FUCK!

Barb: Yeah! Imagine my surprise when a semi-truck pulls into my driveway with a six-foot-tall statue…of ME!

Logistician: Statue of you?

Barb: (Pointing) Yeah! It’s Saint Barbara. I have a crown. I have sword, and I have my damn wine glass…

James: Goblet…

Barb: Oh Whatever. IT. IS. **AWESOME!** I almost don’t want to retire because I am wondering how you would outdo this!

Sloppy: We are just happy you like it.

Barb: I don’t know how you got the address to my new house, but this statue is perfect for my garden!

Dear Reader, it was truly the best gift I had ever given. The statue adorns her front yard. It is front-and-center and overwatches her garden. Thankfully Barb is living the retired life, and not moving, because we are always seeking to outdo ourselves. If there is will, there is a way. Anyways, I hope I provided a jolly ole laugh!

Lastly, I hope you enjoy the Holiday Season and chestnuts roasting on an open fire. Please remember, its “chestnuts” not “chin-nuts.”

Cheers,

Sloppy","3668"

**PFC BikerJedi and Christmas on the Korean DMZ**

Being away from home during the holidays is always difficult, especially as a young person. Going into the military is a jarring experience for anyone, even an Army brat like me. The entire culture of your life shifts dramatically overnight. Suddenly one day you realize the holidays are coming and you aren't going home.

It's all part of growing up. Back at Ft. Bliss some guys got leave, one guy had family in El Paso, others got ""adopted"" but most of us just hung out at the barracks and bowling alley, drinking. The mess hall always did a competent job. And by that I mean they fed us well. In Korea, unless you were already on mid-term leave for that time frame, you weren't going home. But again, the mess hall fed us well. And soldiers like to eat.

Thanksgiving in Korea was pretty decent. I mentioned before the mess hall NCIOC won an award for best cook in the Pacific Rim, so we always ate well at Camp RC #4. Certainly better than at Ft. Bliss, and it was decent enough there. Huge spread that he and the guys worked on overnight. 

A few days before Christmas we get told the USO is bringing the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders up to the DMZ for a show. Before I get into this, I am a huge Cowboys fan. Have been since I saw my first game on TV. Too bad we haven't won shit since '96. Ugh. So I am super excited.

There are two cheerleading squads. The game squad and the traveling squad, which I didn't know. So the night of the show they pack our battery as well as the MP company and field artillery battery from down the road into a gym. A big stage has been set up. These ladies were amazing. They gave us a 90 minute show. Singing, dancing, line kicks, the whole thing. Kind of a burlesque show. They looked great and were super friendly to all of us. They hung around after the show giving autographs and chatting.

Even the (many) guys who weren't Cowboys fans were having a great time. Who wouldn't with all those great looking women around? None of us had seen a non-Korean woman in months unless we had been home on leave. (Not that Korean women aren't pleasant to look at - it was a change of scenery for us - cheerleaders!) I vaguely remember some other entertainment that night, but to be honest, I forgot what it was. Being a Cowboys fan and getting to meet and talk to the cheerleaders was neat. 

Christmas day brought another huge feast. I called home and spoke to my family as well. About a week later a package from home with some presents finally made it to me. 

All in all, it was the best Christmas I had in my four years in. The two at Ft. Bliss were boring as well and I just got drunk, and Christmas in Saudi for Desert Shield was spent in a sandstorm. Ugh.

Jerry Jones is an asshole owner, but having a traveling squad that was going around the world for the military shows was great. The USO is an amazing organization.

**PFC BikerJedi and Christmas Eve in the Sands of Saudi Arabia**

By time Christmas Eve rolled around, we hadn't been deployed to our forward positions a kilometer from the Iraqi border yet. We also hadn't started bombing the Iraqis either, as it was still Desert Shield and hadn't become Desert Storm, so things were still relatively peaceful.

The morning of Christmas Eve we got recalled to the battery TOC (Tactical Operations Center) where the battery was headquartered. Two days of down time was announced. At the formation, it was announced that two of us would be driven back to KKMC then flown out to a literal fucking cruise ship parked in the gulf for a few days of R&amp;R. We couldn't believe it, but I guess one of the cruise lines decided to do something for the coalition troops. I wasn't one of them, but my drinking buddy was and some dude from first platoon. We gave them both the evil eye as they grabbed their shit and hopped on the truck. (He had a great time - lots of food and booze, but he said almost no women.) It was only two of us because they were pulling two from every company/battery in the area.

Hot chow and downtime and all that followed formation. The normally cold boonie showers were hot - our cooks had boiled a shit ton of water for us and continued to do so. It was heavily rationed so you only got a few minutes - but shit - a hot shower after months in the desert! I actually felt clean, but it was like shedding a second skin in there. Whore baths just don't do a lot for you over time.

A volleyball net appeared and guys spent time trying to be cool like Maverick and Goose in Top Gun. (**Narrator:** *They weren't.*) Weapons cleaning, music from a boom-box, dancing, cards, gambling, etc. Just general screwing around and trying to relax. Some commerce was done when an E-6 came back from KKMC with about 100 cartons of cigarettes, a ton of batteries, etc. He sold out quickly.

Chow rolls around for the second time. We ended up with three ""hot"" meals those days, but they were all T-Rations. For you civilians out there, t-rats are basically a prepared meal in a tin type things - they just heat and serve them. Our cooks always had a love/hate relationship with the things. They loved them because they were easy. They hated them because they wanted to feed us good food like they did back in garrison and couldn't. With every sloppy spoonful of food that went ""splat"" on our trays went a shrug and an apologetic look ""Sorry, brother."" (For those of you who are younger than I and are in or have been recently - I am aware our military largely gets fed bullshit by civilian contractors now. I'm sorry for you. We had actual soldiers, whose sole job it was to feed us. There were literal MOS's for cooks. It was always good food. They gave a shit.)

Still, the T-rations were WAY better than eating MRE's three meals a day. So no one really bitched.

After lunch, we had a brief formation. Someone had brought in a video camera. Each of us would be allowed to record a VHS tape to send home to our family. Order was determined by platoon, and someone kept a list and found you when it was time. My platoon wasn't going until after dinner.

They had it set up in a small tent so you had some privacy - the camera that is. I sat in that chair and stared at the camera, not sure what to say. I mean, here I am, it is looking more and more by the day like we are going to have to fight, and it is Christmas Eve. It isn't like millions of other men haven't been in similar positions over the years. So I blathered on about missing home and such and called it good. The video got dropped in the mail. Other than letters, I got a single four minute phone call home way back in the early fall when we showed up and that was it.

Incidentally, I got to see the tape when I got home. I looked and felt stupid. Ugh.

Christmas Day - for the first and only time on active duty we were allowed to sleep in. I mean, NO wake up call. NO formation. It was great. Which was good, because I was buried again. I found that out when I rolled over and a bunch of sand fell on my face as I poked it out.

I mentioned previously in other stories that I slept up on top of the Vulcan 99% of the time, inside my mummy bag. One, to be close to the vehicle in case of emergency, and two, I wasn't a fan of scorpions. They could crawl up there but didn't. They did like to go in the tent where my squad mates slept. Fuck that. In any case, we had a hell of a sandstorm overnight, and I was literally buried in sand. (This had happened twice before) It had piled up behind my back and formed a dune. A smaller dune had formed in the area created between my knees and chest as I had curled up a bit. I had maybe an inch or two of sand over the rest of me. The Vulcan itself wasn't buried other than that inch or two on top, but we spent about 20 minutes that morning digging out the back door so that the TC could climb in.

We also had to do a good couple hours of maintenance on the gun itself. Even though it was covered when we went to bed, there was a ton of sand in the turret, the electronics and some in the barrels. We had to pull a lot of it apart and clean it. So much for a day off. This is how a 16S (MANPADS/Stinger Missile gunner) gets cross trained as a 16R (Vulcan crewmember). Lol.

I have to quote Star Wars here: **Anakin Skywalker**: *""I don’t like sand. It’s coarse and rough and irritating… and it gets everywhere.""*

The rest of the day was kind of a repeat of Christmas Eve, except this time for dinner it was turkey/stuffing/gravy t-rats, so it kinda felt like the holidays. Then they did it AGAIN.

This being the Kingdom of Saud, alcohol is a no-go. But just like with Thanksgiving, the Army had brought in some fake beer. So we all get, again, two non-alcoholic beers. Warm. Why? I dunno, maybe it had something to do with the lack of refrigeration and all the sand. Pissed, I gave mine away and had fond memories of Christmas in Korea the year before while also wishing to be home in Colorado with a COLD beer.

And by the way, those Saudi hypocrites turn a blind eye to foreigners living in compounds who work for the oil company - they brew their own stuff there. (At least they did in 1991 when I was there.) So it's OK for oil workers, but not for guys who are going to be bleeding for you. 

I wrote about My 100 hours [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/imt4e2/my_100_hours/). I can tell you that when we went across that border, we were pissed about three things, and it showed:

* Almost six months of sheer boredom
* Dozens of SCUD attacks that forced us to spend hours in MOPP4 in the desert heat (That is your protective gear from nuclear, biological and chemical attacks. Hot as hell.)
* **Mutha-fuckin fake beer two holidays in a row!!**

Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays everyone. I hope next year finds you better than this one did.

"122","""Oh Brothers, where art thou?"" The word ""Brother"" is over-saturated with meaning. I have two biological brothers. ""Oh brother!"" is usually followed by an explanation of just much you fucked up whatever it was that you thought you were doing.

But the Brotherhood of us - we who thought we were risking life and limb, and found out that death wasn't the worst thing - there's boredom, discomfort and random slaughter of people you swore to protect... We were tested and seared in different places at different times, but the Brotherhood binds us. And sometimes the younger Brothers undertake teaching their Grandpas to suck eggs. It's amusing, and forgivable.

&gt;Another good thing - I've been home long enough that sometimes I have to tell myself that. I'll start to bitch about something that is just not a big deal, and then I remember when I had it a million times worse.

I did that just last night. We had a wind storm that sounded like it was doing a lot more damage than it did, and I was taking it all very personally. I proceeded get all pissy about it and insult the sky and clouds and wind with enough vigor to eventually make myself laugh. C'mon. Wind? You're lucky it's *just* wind.

I am an idiot. I know this because I volunteered for the Brotherhood, way back in 1966. Apparently, there is no cure for that, nor the grim Brotherhood neither. What did Pogo say? ""If it wasn't for the honor, I'd just as soon skip it.""","4116"
"123","u/Lisa85603's CSM story reminded me of my Board back in the winter of 2011. One question remains a cherished memory while another caused internal panic at 200%. Board consists of the CSM, my 1SG, and 2 SSG filling on for their company's 1SGs.

SSG: Where can I find developmental counseling?   
Me: You can find developmental counseling in FM 6-22  
SSG: What specific subsection for developmental counseling though?   
Me: Well I can't remember off the top of my head but if you happen to have a pdf-

The CSM and my 1SG immediately bust out laughing shocking me into silence and confused panic. After they collect themselves, they go on to explain that before they started the Board, they had been discussing how the Army was shifting from hard copy to digital mediums and here I was talking about pdfs. Then they told me to proceed with my answer again.

Me: So if you have a pdf of FM 6-22, you can hit Ctrl+F to bring up the search function and type in developmental counseling.   
SSG: So when I do that I'll be at the developmental counseling section?   
Me: Well you'll probably end up in the Table of Contents first so you might have to hit Enter a few times.

He angrily stated he had no more questions for me. 

\--------------

Eventually we got to the World Events Question. This one I can't remember the question so well but the jist of it is:  

CSM: Due to today's death, a new world power has come to the stage. Why is this new world leader such a disruption amongst today's world leaders?

There I am, in a panic, trying to figure out who the fuck just died. I might be roomed on the 6th floor, but I live under a rock. Who just died?! I have no fucking idea, what would make a bunch of world leaders upset with the replacement. Kim Jung-eun is young, so that would be the disruption, but Jung-Il didn't die today. Who the fuck just died?!? Or does he mean Jung-Il because he's getting buried today, that must be it. Where I then give my more elaborated answer of Jung-Eun because young and  world leaders are old. Yes, that had been the right answer.

After the board, my Squad Leader came over and told me he was shitting bricks in the corner where I couldn't see him during the silence while I was mentally processing the question.

\------------

When I got promoted a couple months later, I was pulling Gate Guard with my squad and we did 15min rotations because some of the stops didn't have a heater. SFC AH showed up to temp replace me and told to get to the company ASAP. Didn't even know I was being pinned until I got there. Fast forward a like a half hour to hour and now a new E5.

1SG: Do you have anything to say now that you're a SGT?  
Me: Can I go back to my Gate Guard duties now? o-o;;

I think I caught the 1SG off guard with my reply. I don't remember what followed other than someone gave me a lift to the Gate so I could get back faster. I'd been right in assuming SFC AH hadn't rotated my guys meaning the one in the back had been shivering in the unheated shack this entire time.

"124","I felt so bad for my friends. Was suppose to be a 35P but I failed and ended up a 35N. Ended up in the same unit as some of them and their points were maxed out.

Nothing more fun than a SFC Tanker trying to throw weight when inside the SCIF knowledge trumps rank. SFC Tanker being SFC AH. Fucking hated that man.

"125","So it is the spring of '03. We get word that we are deploying and the destination is Iraq. Now, as you know, we don't always get much advance notice of a deployment. Especially in that Post-911 era.

Now I was both pumped and a bit worried about this deployment. It was my first war after all. Who wouldn't be nervous. Now some soldier (marines, airmen, sailors, guardians) like to spend time with family, get affairs in order, or do something else before they deploy somewhere. Me, I just wanted to get some Jack Daniels in me and get laid.

Well, two of the guys in the unit who weren't deploying wanted to give me a great send off so they arranged for a night of fun for me. Lets call them Hopper and Bragg. Hopper can drink any man under the table. He was the one who helped me get Tony drunk for his 21st.  Bragg is.... well he's a big ass MP. Like 6'4, 230 lbs, and stocky. A teddy bear to his friends, but a beast at work. These men, my brothers from another mother, are true friends. They took me to a great dinner at TGIFridays (my favorite restaurant). Then they took me to a club that specializes in hard rock and metal music. It was at this place that Operation Get Laid Before Iraq took place.

Now, the bar wasn't took full. It was ridiculously quiet for a Saturday night. I remember that something was going on in town. Some event, but I don't remember what exactly. The lack of a crowd is what inspired me to try to get laid that night. You see, the band playing was a Canadian band made up of 3 girls and a guy. Their name was Big Muff. I shit you not. They named themselves Big Muff and their handed out brightly colored condoms with their band's name on the wrapper. Another thing that spurred me on. Free rain gear for the mission.

Now these girls were all hot. All of them between a 8.5 and a 9. The lead guitar was a cute brunette, the drummer a bleach blonde (not natural), and the bass player was a red head. I LOVE redheads. After talking to the guys, we all decided to try and get acquainted with the band.

By midnight or so, the bar was dead and we were actually sitting around with the band drinking and flirting. The male member(keyboardist) of the group didn't join us. He decided to load up the van even though we offered him a drink. So we chatted up these goddesses from the frozen North and it was going very well. Then Hopper let it be know I was deploying soon and they were making sure my last days were something special.

Hopper has a mind for these things. This peeked the ladies attention. We kept the conversation going towards continuing the party somewhere else. The ladies were all in agreement. Hopper suggest going back to the post, but Bragg suggested an off post location he knew that wasn't far. it was quiet and we could bring a bottle or two and continue the fun. We all agreed with Braggs plan. At that moment I knew I was going to get something.

And I did. I got cock-blocked. The keyboard player arrived as we were gathering our stuff and making ready to head out. I think we all forgot about him. He said they should hit the road.

Both Bragg and Hopper tried to explain that we had made plans to continue the evening somewhere else. The keyboardist repeated that they should hit the road right away. Hopper explained the ladies wanted to celebrate my deployment with us.

I think the keyboard player knew where the night was headed and was either trying to be the ladies protector or didn't like anyone hooking up with his band mates. Either way, he went on and on about needing to get going.

Finally, Bragg, with his frying pan sized hands, guided the young man to the side and talked to him for about a minute and a half. At the end, the keyboardist, like an angry mother, insisted the girls come with him now and they HAD to get on the road immediately.

So the girl listen to him. I got an amazing kiss goodbye from the redhead. Did I mention I LOVE redheads? She was an amazing kisser. She even guided my hand towards her ass for a squeeze goodbye. Hopper got a kiss on the cheek from the lead singer. Bragg got a smack on his ass from the drummer. I swear the look on his face made me wonder if he was going to run over and carry her away to Vegas after she did that.

So we went back to post and spend the rest of the night talking about how close we were. I finally asked Bragg what he said to the gy and he told us he offered to set the keyboardist up with a waitress at the bar that Bragg knew and even pay for his hotel room. He told the guy ""Your girls give out condoms. Let my boy use a few of them tonight  with the redhead.""

I guess the keyboardist didn't like that. Well, that is how my brothers gave me a great night out and tried to get me laid. Battle brother supporting each other.","4258"

First, a shout out to my fellow Coasties and this SubReddit.  This subreddit is first, and foremost, a place for servicemen and women to tell their stories, both good and bad, about their experiences. In  anonymity.  To my fellow Coasties, If you have worked SAR for a while, trust me, you have some level of PTSD. Especially you small boaters and helo bubbas.  It cannot NOT affect you, at some level, if you have pulled out floaters, bodies, picked up folks that have been in boat and plane accidents, etc. then you probably do. Coasties don't generally talk about PTSD in the same sentence that has the words Coast Guard in it. If you were a front line Coastie, worked SAR (which we all try to do), and you are having issues, no matter how big or small, please seek help. Look at professional help through the VA. Post something you have gone through here. Trust me it helps to talk about it. Just putting it into words, oral or written helps.  Trust me on this. On to the story.

**The Ice Cream Man.** Around the second week after Katrina hit, things were getting into a routine. We still didn't have electricity other than emergency generators, there were no bathrooms (we had 2 porta potties for 200 people that, maybe, were cleaned once a week, no internet which meant computers were paperweights, smartphones were pretty useless as the towers were down (even if you could find a working outlet to charge them), there was no such thing as refrigerators, let alone such a thing as ice, and we were living on MRE's and the pizza and wings that were flown in from Mobile and Houston. But by then, it had become the norm and we lived with it.

On a positive note, it was around then that the trailer park was being built, and we were expecting the field kitchen to be brought in any day. Things were looking up on the ground. I was working 18-hour days daily and sleeping on a mattress on the floor in my office. But I was sleeping like a king compared to most of the 200 people working at the air station (airsta).

Somewhere in that week I was asked to go to Mobile on some official business or other. So I boarded a helo and off I went, still in awe of the destruction of the storm along the Coastline between NOLA and Mobile. After all, I had flown this area, off and on, for over 20 years! I just didn't recognize it now.

Once we landed and I took care of the official business, I went looking for my peer at Mobile, the Command Master Chief (CMC), who was a career long friend. The Coast Guard only has approximately 5,000 people to man the 17 Coast Guard Air Stations around the country. As you move towards the top ranks, we all know each other and if not been stationed together at one point or another, then you know the rest by reputation. For example, I believe, back then, there were only 27 E-9's in CG aviation. (This is important for an upcoming story!)

Well, I finally found CMC CGAS Mobile and we caught up. Mike told me the stuff he was working on and I told him my issues and what was happening.  Somewhere along the line we ended up at the CG exchange at CGAS Mobile and he introduced me to the guy in charge of the exchange. We ended up in his office and Mike asked me to tell the store manager some of my issues, which I did. The manager at some point called in some of his subordinates cause he wanted them to hear my stories. I didn't think anything of it as everyone was curious about what it was like at ground zero. I was asked what is probably the number one thing I would want over at NOLA if I could have a wish. I said something cold. And laughed. I didn't give such a pipe dream a second thought.

2 days later I get called to the flight line as somebody sent me something. WTF? So I drove the electric golf cart my CO had given me when I returned from NAS Meridian, since my SUV was still at NAS Meridian, with CG flag flying proud from the back left quarter. Well, I got to the flight line and was given this canvas thing about 2 'x 2' x 4'. I had no idea what it was. It reminded me of the thing my grade school bus driver had at the front of the bus on the last day of school every year when he gave each kid an ice cream bar as they got off (God Bless ya Chuck, wherever you are!)

But once I opened the top, sure enough, it was the same thing Chuck had used all those years ago. Dry ice on the bottom and ice pops (those flavored ice things that are about a foot long and an inch or so wide) on the inside. I quickly closed it up tight as I didn't want the 90-degree temps to get to them and hauled ass back to the air sta.

First stop was the CO's office. I barged into his office and all but threw one at him.  He looked at it, then looked at me, then at it, and then at me, and stammered, where, how did you... I cut him off and said Skipper, never ask a masterchief how they get things done and left him as he just stared at the ice pop.

As I left the Admin building I called every person I could see to come here and started passing these gifts from heaven out before they melted. It didn't take long for the word to get out and everybody came running, even the night shift (even though it was the middle of their night.)  I had that container emptied in about a half hour which resulted in a very happy, smiling crew. I wasn't even upset when I realized I didn't get one.

Sometime during that happy chaotic time, I found a note. With compliments from the Mobile Exchange. And it didn't stop there. Every so often I was again summoned to the flight line to pick up a 2' x 2' x 4' container filled with a treat that was... COLD! Wash, Rinse, and Repeat the happy chaos right up until we got electricity back.

I honestly didn't realize at the time what a big deal this was until months later. I mean, I was just happy to give these hard-working heroes an unexpected treat! It was a great distraction. A publication was put out by the Coast Guard about Katrina. It told the story about Katrina from a Coast Guard perspective. The good, the bad, and yup, the ugly. In it was an article penned by my XO about me and my shenanigans during Katrina. What was this article called? After all the other stuff I did?  You got it. ""The Ice Cream Man""

Thanks for reading and see you next time.","4343"
"128","This reminds me of that not-really-all-that-old James Nicoll quotation:

*The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We don't just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.*","4352"
"129","Not sure what to flair this as, but given what I felt when writing it, I'm choosing the flair it has.

*To commune with others: Familiar interchange of ideas or sentiments: communion; intercourse; friendly conversation.* 

It's a lot more than that. Shared experiences like that often run incredibly deep and are more than conversations. It can be a deep emotional sharing. Just being able to look another veteran in the eyes and see they understand. This is why so many of us call each other brother.

So here is another tale I do NOT want to tell. At all. Nope. But I have to. Be forewarned, it is a long one. Also, I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't support what /r/MilitaryStories is about: Sharing our truths; getting that shit out. So I have to share my truth, and get it out. I ask y'all to do it where you can, so I have to set the example.

I can spit out a story in four to six hours if I'm **really** inspired. I've been chewing on this one in one form or another for about eight years or so. When I mentioned it the first time, I lied about it. So I hope you appreciate it, because it is hard for me to share this. For a *LOT* of reasons. It is terrifying so be this honest with strangers. I guess baring one's soul always is. This is the first part of communing with others - being with you all in /r/MilitaryStories. Because a lot of you get it. 

When I got home from Iraq, I was fucked. Mentally, emotionally, and physically. The near-death experience during surgery fucked me up almost as much as the combat in Iraq did. For those who haven't read everything, I woke up during surgery for my fucked up foot, and they gave me too much gas or something to put me back under. I had a ""cardiac event"" and woke up to several badly bruised ribs from the CPR. Good times. According to the charge nurse, I came *this* close to dying, even though somehow that event never made it into my military records.

Funny how that works. The one shred of evidence I needed for my VA claim, just not there. After nearly dying multiple times while in Iraq, nearly dying in Saudi Arabia in a MASH operating room was just some horrible icing on a shit cake. 

That last year I was in the Army and dealing with my imminent discharge and divorce was horrible. My fucked up foot wasn't getting any better, and I saw the proverbial writing on the wall. I began to drink more. At first it was, ""*I've been in the desert six+ fucking months, all we had was O'Douls. I'm going to party.*"" Because I realized almost immediately I was fucked. Then it was, ""*My foot fucking hurts, so I'm gong to party.*"" Later, although I didn't realize it at the time, it was about ""*I saw a few thousand bodies strewn across the desert. I participated in the killing of a few dudes. So I'm gonna party because I'm tired of thinking about it.*"" It was also very much about, ""*I'm now physically and mentally dependent on alcohol, so I* **need** *it.*"" But you ignore that last voice.

In the middle of all this, there wasn't any real mental health support at scale on post. I was reluctant to make an appointment given that my ex-wife worked over there in that department. So all I had was alcohol and Motrin. From an earlier story:

&gt;For those who don't know, Motrin is the only thing stocked in Army pharmacies around the world. They don't carry a single other drug other than Penicillin, which I am deathly allergic to. My sister and I have a joke about the Army and Motrin. When I got out and had all that pain at the surgery site, the Army, and later the VA, gave me 800mg of Motrin x3 daily. For years. So we joke that it is prescribed for everything.

&gt;Got a concussion? Motrin. Break a leg? Motrin. Cancer? Lots of liquid Motrin. PTSD? Motrin. Rectal bleeding? Shove some fucking Motrin up there. Decapitated? Bring in your head and we'll stitch it back on with Motrin infused thread. Your weapon malfunction? Give it Motrin. IED blew up your buddy? Tell him to take some damn Motrin. National debt too high? Make money out of Motrin.

&gt;FUCK MOTRIN. That shit ate a hole in my stomach lining and gave me an ulcer. Seriously, fuck it. Fuck it and fuck the asshat who invented it. Fuck the asshat who decided it was the new Army go-to wonder drug. Fuck. 

The communing with others began as hanging out with the some guys who got it. Some of us came home and were seemingly OK. They looked at the those of us who were suffering with disdain, wonder or pity. So I hung out and drank with my friends more. We were dispersed over the battlefield and had different experiences. We all had shit we didn't want to remember. When I eventually got my own apartment, I was waking up still vaguely drunk from the night before as I threw on my clothes for the day. We rarely talked about anything of substance related to Iraq, but being together made it better for me. Sometimes communing is a drunken hug in a bar. Sometimes a quick chat by the smoke pit. But you COMMUNE with each other. You are forever connected by a shared experience.

It wasn't long before I was committing the cardinal sin of drinking in uniform. I would hit a dive bar on the way home that had a cute Korean bartender and have a few. This is something that could have gotten me in trouble. But at this point, I was only communing with fellow drunks and didn't give a fuck. They didn't get what I was dealing with, but we were all lovers with lady alcohol, so we hung out together at the bar. Communing with literal spirits.

The day I got out of the Army they handed me a check for $9,998. This was 1992. That was a fair bit of cash. I was shell-shocked at the idea I was a civilian now. Living and working with others who all had a shared goal and purpose was addicting in its own way, and I missed it already. I was hanging with another E4 who was helping me out-process. He wasn't in my squad, but was in the battery. It was so bizarre - he just blurted out ""*Dude, you can do all the cocaine you want now.*""

That was how I found out a good percentage of the battery was on cocaine. 

So, I'm going to take a side tour and be honest, come clean and all that, like I alluded to above. Because I owe this sub this truth. Y'all have given me so much. Including a place to heal. Two years ago, I wrote [THIS STORY](https://old.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/j89lc2/the_fake_cop_in_our_unit_and_how_he_sorta_exposed/). I said this:

&gt;The night I got out, one of the guys I was friendly with offered me some cocaine while out at the bar. Not my thing, so no thanks. 

That is bullshit, and I'm sorry as both an author and a moderator that I wrote it. I was trying to protect myself a bit. That, and it is still hard to admit. Even though drug dependency isn't something to necessarily be ashamed of, I still feel it. And I've been clean of cocaine for nearly 25 years.

The truth is, when he said those magic ten words ""*Dude, you can do all the cocaine you want now*"" I said the magic one word in response: ""*Cool.*"" I didn't really care if I lived or died at this point. I had nothing but a Uhaul with my stuff and too much cash. I didn't have a purpose anymore. No more communing with my battery mates as we ran and sang PT, worked in the motor pool, went to the range, etc. As fucked up as I was becoming, I was sad I wouldn't be around for the next conflict, whatever it was.

A few hours later we are sitting in my new car cutting up lines of incredibly pure cocaine on the center console. He is literally teaching me: This is how you smash it up, cut it up, how to gum it, etc. We are railing lines through hundred dollar bills and I let him keep his as a thanks for hooking me up. And again, this is El Paso, Texas. The border to Juarez, Mexico is incredibly easy to cross. The cocaine I had there was the purest I ever had. When I was ready to head home weeks later, I drove home across state lines with half an ounce of some shit I'm sure was nearly pure. 

After my discharge, hanging out with others who had been through some shit, and doing a lot of drugs, I was communing with others. Most of them hadn't served, but they had been to some dark places. None of it was the healthy kind of communing.

Despite my extensive support network with my family, it was so hard adjusting. I couldn't even commune with the old man. He had been through some shit in Vietnam during his year tour, so he couldn't understand how four days fucked me up so badly. I wasn't killing people in hand to hand combat like he was. But going to sleep at night, all I could hear was the firing of tanks, MLRS systems, howitzers, the occasional small arms. I could smell the desert, the oil well fires. I could visualize the bodies without even trying. I could *feel* the fucking desert heat on me sometimes. The screaming in my head just wouldn't end. The VA didn't help for a while. It seems as soon as I started trying to claim Gulf War Syndrome it became hard to access care. After saying the word ""suicide"" I got some help from them.

There was a wonderful woman in Colorado who worked for the VA. She was much older than I was. Wise. She encouraged my horrible poetry, which was probably a precursor to my writings here. She saved me when I was ready to end it. She hadn't been to combat, but had treated hundreds of vets with PTSD. I could commune with her to an extent. And she spent a good two to three years helping me out. I got through things, met my current wife, got through college, and made a life for myself. 

I communed with others at meetings of Narcotics Anonymous, where I shared some of my very deepest, darkest shit. Communing with others like this was hard, but it was incredibly liberating, something I feel today. Sitting around a large table with other leather clad bikers - most of us at the meetings I went to rode - and a bunch of others. Crying tears as you hear another share their shit. So many of them had ""Been there, done that"" when I was in those rooms. Communing with others.

That is what bikers do. They ride with each other. Protect each other in traffic. Commune with each other. It was funny, one of my sponsors in NA was a biker. He taught me to ride and got me on Harley Davidsons. The first time I called him ""brother"" he gave me a long lecture about how serious of a word that was. ""Brother, I used it purposefully. I feel the same way about you I feel about my bros in Alpha battery."" Turned out he had taken a shine to me as well.

Addicts in recovery do the same. Lift each other up, and guide each other through recovery. There to commune when you fall. You get through that horrible shit out by sharing with each other. Having bikers and addicts and biker-addicts there to help me through my shit was next level. Not one of them served. I'd fight with every last one of them.

I was at an event for veterans about two years after I got out. It was very emotional. For no particular reason I broke down in tears. It wasn't long before some dude bigger than me (I'm 6'4"" and over 220 pounds) came up and wrapped me up in a bear hug. He wouldn't let go until I had my shit together. Because he understood. We spoke a bit and went our ways. Just another veteran just out there communing with others, and pulling them back from the edge. That communing with others - it saved my fucking life.

You all help keep me going. Because I can commune with you. I've even been able to do so with a number of our civilian supporters here. Thank you. And just so you all know, I'm doing fine today. Have been for a while.

On to the story. Understand that back in 2005 I believe the Coast Guard had a whopping 3, maybe 4, 3-star admirals AKA Vice-Admirals.  So, we are taking about one of the top 4 or 5 people in the CG. When the FEMA guy in charge of the Katrina Recovery was relieved, he was replaced by THE Admiral.  I had only met THE Admiral once before at a CG's top enlisted schools, Command Master Chief Keystone School (this was only the 2nd class to graduate, and I understand its name had been changed but it's what we called it back then) graduation. As the class leader I introduced him as the keynote speaker.

Skip ahead to several weeks post Katrina. Also, for context, you must know that so everyone wouldn't burn out, it was required that, I believe, after 6 days working 12 hours on-12 hours off, they were required to fly to either Mobile AL or Houston, TX for 3 days R&amp;R. Needless to say, I never went.  I would sleep in my own bed in the still off-limits housing and ate at the CG air station's (AKA airsta) field kitchen. If I got bored, I'd join some junior enlisteds who were delivering goods and water to outlying CG units. On this particular Sunday we visited a station about 2 hours away, so I got some good sightseeing in while still doing something helpful.

When we returned, I checked in at the ops center and found out that former Presidents Bush and Clinton were flying in to meet with the senior officers and folks (all admirals, generals, and SES's) (civilian equivalents of same)) on base.  So, I said I'm heading over to see THE Admiral and say hi. I was told to take a LT (O3) with me as he had business there. The LT didn't look happy to be crashing the flag's party but rode along. He kept trying to come up with reasons not to go, like what if we walk in on the presidents? I said stuff like if they are there, there will be Secret Service folks outside the door, and such. I'm greeted by the Navy airsta Ops Boss at the door and greeted like an old friend which confused the LT even more. Then he, and I, had our socks knocked off. I was suddenly in a bear hug and being swung around in a circle. WTF? As I was set down, I spun around to see one of my best buddies from school some 30 years before, and whom I hadn't seen since - in front of about 20 or so high-ranking VIP's, including THE Admiral who was seated front row center. I heard his aide ask who I was and THE Admiral replied I dunno, one of my Chief of Staff's friends. Holy crap, my bud was an O6 and Chief of Staff?

After a bit of small talk and reintroductions, which seemed to have all the VIP's attention, I made the remark please forgive my appearance, I just got back from a work detail delivering water to station outlier. THE Admiral remarked he was just there this past week. I said (me being me) I know. I had to save your family's reputation. THE Admiral leaned back and said Do tell. I said that the outlying station called your Daddy a Bos'n Mate but I let them know he was a turd chaser. You could have heard a pin drop in that room. (Now the CG and Navy enlisted rates, or MOS's, all have nicknames. THE Admiral was very proud that his father was a Chief Damage Controlman, who were responsible for ship's plumbing. Thus, the nickname Turd Chaser.)  It was funny to see all those VIP's jaws wide open when THE Admiral replied, thank you Master Chief!  That is what this guy was like. He's one of the good ones.

After about a week, THE Admiral who had a place in New Orleans apparently found out that he couldn't get any peace and quiet or get any work done there. So we moved a trailer from the trailer park over by the Admin building for him. It was known as THE Admiral's Hide Away. He stayed there often. It was not unusual for him to show up at the most nights-ly get together of enlisted where the day crew would pull up chairs and just hang out and have a cold one or two (which would mysteriously show up since NOLA was still a no alcohol area) with the troops. No one asked about the adult beverages.

Another time THE Admiral was handing out his challenge coins on the hangar deck. I forget why I needed one for somebody (probably to barter with someone for something) and THE Admiral gave me his last one. As I walked away, one of my Chiefs cussed me up and down (not in front of THE Admiral) as he had patiently waited in line and I swooped in and took his last one. I said I'd get him one.  Later I told THE Admiral about it.  Next morning, I ran into THE Admiral and he suggested that we go give the chief his coin. On the way over to the trailer park he told me what he wanted to do. We got to the chief's trailer and I knocked on the door only to be met with a loud voice yelling who is it? I said CMC. He yells back Fuck off! I'm still pissed about yesterday! I been up all night and I'm off duty! I said open the damned door! Quickly THE Admiral swapped places with me while the Chief was calling me every name in the book and cussing like the sailor he was. The look on his face as he opened the door yelling WTF do you want? and saw THE Admiral standing in front of him was priceless. Especially, without skipping a beat, THE Admiral said I just wanted to give you my coin for all the hard work you've been doing.  That was THE Admiral. Foot note: Next time I saw the chief, he said he wasn't sure if he wanted to kiss me for getting him one of those coins or knock me out. My crew was awesome.

Well, it finally caught up to me about staying in NOLA during mandatory down time. As I walked somewhere, the CO was with THE Admiral and called me over. The CO asked what I was planning to do        during my ""weekend."" I said same as usual. I said I'd find something to do. THE Admiral replied you are to do NOTHING this weekend. And that is an order! CRAP! My plans to actually get downtown with one of our supply convoys was instantly crushed. All I could say was Aye-Aye, Sir.

The next morning, I show up for breakfast in our field kitchen (which was actually a semi-trailer, and as I walked through the door, I hear a BOOMING voice yell, MAS-TER-CHIEF! I thought, Oh shit! what's he doing here? The voice continues booming across the trailer, DIDN'T I ORDER YOU TO STAY AWAY THIS WEEKEND? Another pin dropping moment as all heads are swiveling between the two of us. It's not often you get to see a 3-star admiral publicly call out an E9.

I replied somewhat sheepishly, Admiral, you said I shouldn't do any work. I'm only here to eat since I can't do that where I stay (It wasn't well known that I stay at home and I wanted to keep it that way.) He then said then eat with me so I can make sure you leave when you're done. Otherwise STAY AWAY FROM THE BASE! All I could say was Yes Sir!

I can't say enough good things about THE Admiral and was extremely pleased when he went on to bigger and better things. And continues to do so.

"134","Mission first.  That's a true thing.  There is no way I can accomplish my mission without my team most the time, or accomplish it as well pretty much all the time.  The only way to take care of the mission is to take care of my team.  Most of the time, if I'm taking care of them, they will take care of the mission.  Those that don't take care of the mission get some remedial training and special attention, and if that doesn't work, get an invitation to go find another team.

I've never been the most charismatic leader, and it takes some time for me to earn the trust of teams I've been assigned to ""lead."". Once we have a relationship, though, my teams have almost universally performed well.  Not because I did well; I just did my best to get the doors open they needed when they needed them, and take care of the nonmission crap.  They did the rest.","4917"

"139","Background: I was the Command Master Chief (CMC/E9) at Coast Guard Air Station (CGAS) New Orleans (NOLA) when Hurricane Katrina hit. I had returned 3 days after the storm hit from my TAD/TDY location. My normally busy air station had ballooned from a normal 5 helicopter and 60-person crew to over 200 people and I had no idea how many helos and fixed wing aircraft. All I knew was the air station was a wreck: from people sleeping anywhere they could lay down in the admin building, to relief packages also piled in the hallways of the admin building on top of the grass clippings that were tracked in, to the hangar spaces being declared off limits due to 60 ft of hangar roof being peeled back, to trees laying on the perimeter fence. And I was just informed that I was going to fulfill the duties of 2nd XO as the CO and XO were standing 12 hour alternating watches running flight operations. I was in charge of everything on the ground except the aircraft. I had taken care of the interior of the admin building and the grounds, and the TDY Navy SeaBees had helped me with the downed trees. We are going to jump ahead to about week 3 at this point.  On to the story.

To set the scene let me remind you of my ""nightly routine.""  Now when I returned from NAS Meridian, I had left my SUV there and didn't have wheels to get around in NOLA. The Navy Base was HUGE! So my CO threw me a set of keys and said to use the electric cart he had been given sometime after the storm hit. At the end of my workdays, I would make my rounds in the cart (which I adorned with 3'x4' Coast Guard flag flying proudly off the back left corner.) My first stop was to check in with the SCPO of a detachment SeaBees who were deploying to help at the airsta and were camping out on the golf course. Then I would check in with what was left of the base security force. I should note that after everyone was evacuated before the storm, almost all of the Navy senior enlisted didn't return but were replaced by TAD/TDY units such as the SeaBees. This left the security forces without any chiefs. No one was looking out for that crew. I found this out about the security team when I went to the Base gym, where I saw several members of the security team sleeping on the floor without real pillows or blankets. So I did my best to adopt the security team and get them what they needed. Base housing was off limits as the fire department didn't have enough people to cover the massive number of aircraft flying in and out, as well as base housing. Now I said Base housing was off limits, but me being me, I went to my house every night. Electricity had been turned off, but I was an avid camper being an asst scoutmaster with a local boy scout troop. Thus, I had plenty of battery powered lanterns to light up the house to take a quick cold shower, feed my rats, and get a clean uniform. Then I would swing by the base operations center to check in with the Navy command. Then back to the CG airsta to get some sleep in my office.

A month or two before the Katrina hit, the NAS authorized MWR (Morale, Welfare, &amp; Recreation - the department that would loan or rent items to servicemen to have fun with, runs the gyms, etc) to buy a grill. Not any grill but a HUGE grill/smoker that could rotisserie 50 chickens at a time!  It was the COs pride and joy.  To the point he invited one of the food channels to come for a BBQ and they did and aired it! He loved that thing! Then the storm hit.

Several days later someone noticed that the grill was missing. Oh shit did the feces hit the oscillating device. The CO was pissed is an understatement.  He had the poor head of MWR, the security department, and a few others on his carpet daily wanting to know what had been done and what was being done to find the grill.  The MWR director was a civilian and was responsible for the grill, so he was catching the most heat. He was out looking daily with no success. And he was sweating it!  He had lost a $20,000 grill!

To give you an idea of how theft was thought of during that time, there was a standing order that base housing was off limits. No one was allowed there as electricity was cut off and the fire department did not have enough people to cover an emergency. Then word came out that two different army units had been discovered to have entered base housing and ""borrowed"" two grills from back porches to I suspect give them an alternative to MRE's. Not a bad plan until they got caught.  The Navy CO called the two Army CO's in, and not only read them the riot act, but he also sent both units home, lock, stock and barrel!  Wonder what was left of their careers when they had to explain to THEIR CO's that they had been relieved from the biggest SAR situation the US ever had.

Well one night I was making my rounds and stopped at the Seabee compound. I had come when the SCPO and his Chiefs mess was having a late-night snack. I'm sure you know where this is going.  I asked about their grilled whatever they were eating. Senior asked me if I'd like some, but I responded with I would much rather check out their grill. So in his innocence he took me deep within his compound and low and behold, it's THE GRILL!  And not only was it not in its always pristine shape, but it was also filthy! I grabbed him and took him about 25 yards from anything into the pitch black and hoarse whispered, ""You are FUCKED!"" He asked why and I told him. As dark as it was, I would swear his white face glowed like the moon.  He finally asked what he could do?  We thought about it for a few moments, and I said, how long will it take you to get that thing cleaned up to brand new condition? He asked how much time do I have?  I replied long enough for me to drive that slow ass electric cart to the CG Airstation and return driving a tug (small vehicle used to move aircraft around) back. About an hour so that I can stop every few minutes for a smoke or something. I was actually no more than a quarter mile from the airstation. As I left, I told him that if he can get that thing clean his ass is covered. Otherwise...

I returned an hour and 15 minutes later. I don't know how he did it, but it was spotless. I think it was cleaner than when it came out of the box! He was still visibly nervous, though.  I told him to relax, it's on me now. And towed it back to the CG Airstation and locked it down in our interior compound.

Early the next morning, I was waiting for the MWR Director when he came into work. We chatted for a few minutes, but he seemed like he wanted me to leave. So, I got up and started to walk out the door.  As I walked through the door, I yelled back that he could tell the Navy CO that the grill had been found and I have it. That got his attention as he dropped everything and insisted that I show him.  Now I have to be honest. I occasionally will screw with people and I considered this guy a friend. So, on the 10-minute ride while I was being bombarded with questions like, where did I find it, what shape is it in, etc., I prepared him for the worst. Answering with things like, let's just say I found it and its in one piece and such.  His excited mood was in the dumps by the time we got to the grill. He looked at it, he looked at it again, and literally ran over to it to inspect it.  Then he ran over to me, gave me the biggest bear hug and in a broken voice said thank you thank you thank you, you asshole.

Then he was on his phone.  Not 10 minutes later the Navy CO and XO were there.  They didn't say a thing until after they inspected it. Then the CO came over thanked me in that CO formal voice they all seem to have and asked who had it and where did I find it? I responded, ""Skipper, you know that you should never ask a masterchief how he gets things done. He started to say something, then stopped. Then said you aren't going to tell me, are you? I just said something like I happened to see it beside a building and brought it home. I think he wanted to call me an asshole too but instead said Thank you for finding it.  He greatly appreciated it.

Then he looked at the MWR director and said to get the grill back to his facilities.  Before the director could say anything, in my innocence I said, I could keep it here under 24-hour surveillance and behind 2 gates since MWR didn't have that to offer.  The CO and Director spoke amongst themselves for a few seconds and thought that was a great idea.

As they were walking away, I asked for one more favor. The CO turned around and before I could say anything, said yes you can use it. You know the rules. (Return it cleaner than you received it.)  I said thanks and they left.  It was used quite often by the Coasties and enjoyed.  And the Seabees were off the hook and paid back for taking the trees off my fenceline and replacing the shingles on my admin building. I don't know what happened to that Seabee Senior Chief but I sure as hell hope he made masterchief! He was one of the good ones. All was right in the world.

"141","Working in the Port Operations Department of an MSO is always interesting.  Most boarding's are pretty routine, but there is always a chance of something odd, strange, weird, or outright bizarre. You never know how a boarding is going to play out.  

**Case 1:Getting Home**                                                                                                                                                    Japanese flagged ships are almost always immaculate.  The living areas are neat and clean, their documentation infallible.  The engine room and machinery spaces are as clean as an engine room can possibly be. And of course the Captain and crew live up to the Japanese reputation for courtesy and hospitality.

You can imagine the shock when we were looking around in the walk-in freezer to ensure there was enough food for the crew when we spotted a human body wrapped in plastic. No, you did not miss-read the sentence. There was a plastic wrapped human body in the ships’ frozen meat locker.   And yes, for a few moments we all thought that we were in some real-life Stephen King novel about a ship crewed by cannibals who restocked at every port.

We regained our professional composure and stepped out of the frozen meat locker and started asking *a lot* of questions.  The Captain took it all in stride as this was not his first rodeo on this particular issue.  There was a ton of documentation, an autopsy, official death certificate, permission from the Japanese Foreign Ministry to bring back the remains and so on.  There were *a lot* of phone calls back to the office.  I don’t remember how many times I said, “I’m not kidding” while I was on the phone.    

After about two hours on the phone everything was cleared up.  The ship, the cargo, the crew, living and dead were cleared to leave San Francisco.  Apparently the body was an older crewmember who had died of natural causes on the voyage and they were taking back the remains for a proper burial in Japan.  I guess this was the budget plan for getting the guy home.        

**Case 2: I Trust You**                                                                                                                                                         At a Marine Safety Office the staff will interact with people and cultures from all over the world.  There are many different subtle things an officer or enlisted might have to handle.  Some cultures view dealing with civil servants differently than others.     

Every cargo ship has an office and in the office is a safe.  Sometimes the office is an actual dedicated area, but most of the time the office is a part of the Captain's stateroom.  Stored in the safe are important documents and a large amount of cash, usually U.S. dollars.  The money is on hand to purchase goods and services in areas where credit is not accepted or hard to use...or other uses. 

During the boarding we had found some issues and were in the Captain's stateroom completing the *CG835 Vessel/Facility Inspection Requirements.*  The Captain was at his desk attending to some paperwork and the ship’s safe which was next to his desk was wide open.  I could clearly see the stacks of greenbacks nicely tucked off into one corner of the safe.  The Captain could see that we were writing up a deficiency report and after a few moments made an excuse to leave the office.  When we pointed out to him that the safe was open and there was cash clearly visible, the Captain replied, “Oh, I trust you guys.  Your professionals”. 

While the Captain was out we completed our paperwork and waited for him to return.  After a few minutes the Captain came back to his stateroom.  The look of disappointment on his face was unmistakable when he looked over to see a completed CG835 and no money missing from the safe.   

**Case 3: I Might Have Caused an International Incident**                                                                                       Every boarding is different, but most go off without a hitch.  But. you never know when a boarding can go bad, even when you have left the ship hours earlier.

It started out as a routine boarding of a first-time visitor to the U.S.  That meant the boarding would be more in depth and go over a lot of things that a frequent caller vessel was not subject to.  The boarding went well, so well in fact that I don’t recall a lot of details about this ship or cargo.  I do clearly recall that the crew were from Pakistan.  When I spoke to some members of the crew they seemed to be happy and didn’t report any problems.  So, we completed the boarding and went about our way.

Back at the office I made a quick report to Lt. Verde and then proceeded to enter the required information into the IMIS database.  Everything seemed to be progressing without a hitch.  That evening at home at about 23:30 I was awoken by a phone call from the office.  I was annoyed in general by being woken up.  Annoyed in particular at the interruption of my beauty sleep.  And enormously annoyed at the interruption of a dream I was having involving Pamela Anderson, a fine bottle of single malt scotch, and a bottle of pressurized whipped cream.  I don’t recall a lot of detail about the ship, but I clearly remember my dream about Pamela Anderson.  Call it, somnium recessus, or dreamus interruptus, but it's been 30 years and I still can’t bring that dream back.  

On the phone I find myself in a conference call with Lt. Verde (0-3), the duty officer, Lieutenant Commander (O-4) I-Love-Alaska-and-Everywhere-Else-Sucks (The Head of Port Operations), Captain Mac (O-6) the MSO commanding officer, the 11th District Commander, an an Admiral (0-7),  an Admiral (0-8) from HQ in Washington DC, and a State Department official.  Apparently the crew was unhappy about not being paid and decided enmasse to jump ship earlier that evening.  

You haven’t lived until you are answering questions to senior officers (06’s, 07’s and 0-8's) on a conference call with a State Department official about a potential international incident that you may or may not have created. The highlights of call went like this:  

Lt. Verde: “Petty Officer GooBlatz, did the crew give you any indications about problems with pay during your 835 inspection”?

Me: “Sir, during my inspection the crew did not indicate they were not being paid properly and made no indication they were going to jump ship”. 

0-7: “Do you have any idea where the missing crew members may have gone?”

Me: “No sir, I do not know where the crew may have gone too”. 

State Dept: “Do you have any suggestions on where we should look for the crew?

By this time I knew this was a phone call wanting me to provide answers that I just didn’t have.  I just wanted to cut this call short and get back to Pamela Anderson, the scotch and the whipped cream. 

Me: Well sir, from my experience you might start with the taxi drivers in the Haight-Ashbury district, they all seem to be from Pakistan”. 

0-8: “Thank you for your input “Petty Officer GooBlatz, have a good night”, and my connection dropped off.  

Truly, as an E-4 I was not paid well enough to handle that kind of crap.

**Case 4: Hands off of my LTJG!**                                                                                                                                 I had been assigned to train a new LTJG (0-2), that’s right me and E-4 to train an officer on how to conduct a CG835 boarding.  She was very smart, very attractive and willing to learn.   We were off to her first boarding and when we arrived at the dock I parked the van and looked at her and said that it would be wise to have her remove her rank devices for her first boarding.  When she asked why I said that often the ship’s officers would recognize an officer’s rank and then start questioning or pressuring the officer about the boarding.  I went on to say that until she got her feet on the ground that would not be a good situation for her.

She immediately understood, unpinned her rank insignia and we proceeded with the boarding.  Everything was going great until the closing conference.  We were sitting in the Captain’s stateroom and the Captain began hinting to me about her price (??).  At first I thought it was a cultural miscommunication and I pretended to not understand him, but he wouldn’t let go and his hints became more and more open.  I mean he really thought I was this woman's pimp and we were there to negotiate a price for her services.  WTF!  I looked over and I could see tears just starting to well up in her eyes. 

Ok, first off I am not a pimp.  Second, while I might have been a lowly E-4 she was my responsibility.  Third, my chivalry was coming to boil and I was about to knock the jerk out cold.  Not wanting to be the cause of another potential international incident I just handed the GC 835 to the Captain, took the LTJG by the arm and walked off the ship. Back at the van she just started bawling her eyes out and I apologized to her.  

When we got back to the office she had pulled herself back together and pinned her officer insignia back on her collar.  She smiled sweetly, said it was not my fault.  She was pretty cool with me and would often pop her head into the Bullpen and say “hi” to me.","5178"
"142","It's veteran's day here in the US (thank you for serving all you nuts here), so I'm gonna tell my story, about my worse day, and how I was able to overcome it. 

(trigger warning, shit gets graphic, not gonna apologize for it because it's how it went down. You've been warned) 

As I said in a previous post, I was a army medic in a role II in Afghanistan. Most of our trauma patients were ANA, ANP, and civilians, with some US soldiers mixed in. Most of the outcomes were fairly positive, some-not so much. This is about one of the not so much days.

January 30, 2012. I'll never forget that date as long as a live. At one point just thinking the date would trigger flashbacks, the anniversary filled me with dread in the weeks leading up to it.

It started as a normal day, working my shift in the ER, cleaning, doing inventory, training, ordering medical supplies, or just generally screwing off (you can only count medical supplies so many times before you go nuts, you gotta screw off occasionally). We get a call that a 9-line is coming in, 3 casualties, so kind of a big one (for our 4-bed ER), but manageable. We were told that an ANA unit got ambushed and in a big firefight further north with casualties going to several hospitals, but we were furthest away so we were getting the least emergent (or so we thought). So we start the on-call chain (everyone had pre-paid Roshan cell phones, think Afghani Trac-phones) to get everyone back to the hospital that was off-duty but on call (basically everyone, we didn't have a lot of personnel there). Start getting supplies ready, prepping beds, stuff like that. 

I was medic 1, bed 1. The way we ran things was bed 1 was most severe, medic one secured IV access immediately and then was the doctors second set of hands. Medic 2 hooked up all the equipment to read vital signs then kept an eye on them, was a go-fer for supplies, and kept a general eye one things. Medic 3 was the recorder, write down anything and everything, because in medicine if you don't write it down it never happened. So basically bed 1 was where the best medics went, and medic 1 was a pretty important spot. Without sounding like I'm full of myself, I was a shit-hot medic (as far as trauma was concerned, sick call stuff I was honestly just ok with).

(all the following times are approximate, time and therapy has dulled some of the details, thankfully) 

1130- we get the call that the bird is roughly 15 minutes out, all the patients as stable, it's all good.

1150- the first patient comes flying into the hospital, stretcher carriers hoofing it with the flight medic sprinting beside him. ""we lost vitals on the bird, CPR in progress."" So as soon as he's on the bed I begin compressions (side note, you gotta PUSH for effective CPR, shit is no joke). Our CRNA gets him intubated so no rescue breaths needed, just keep pushing. Side note, no visible external wounds on this guy, just some bruising, not a good sign.

1155- our general surgeon (who had a bit of a god-complex, but he was fucking good so we accepted it) decided to do an emergency department thoracotomy. That's where the doctor makes an incision in between the ribs on the left side of the body, sticks in a spreader and opens the chest up, basically to get a look at the heart and see if there is anything going on. He gets all prepped and tells me ""I'm going to count to 3 and then say move, when I say move you get the fuck out of the way, fast."" He counts, I jump, he cuts the patient open and sees his heart is still attempting to pump. The doc says ""get him into the OR now, dougle40 scrub in, we're going to need extra hands.""

Over the next 3 and a half hours I assist (mainly by holding various organs out of the doctors' way while they attempt to repair internal damage) and learn quite a bit more about how internal organs look, feel, and smell. We think we found all the damage, start sewing him back up to evac him to higher care, and he starts crashing again. The docs open him back up and keep looking for damage. They discover his spleen had ruptured (don't know if they missed it the first go around or if it was damaged and finally said ""fuck it I'm done""), and needed to come out. Now your spleen is tucked up above your stomach, so the easiest way to get to it his have SPC dougle40 hook the bottom of the patients ribcage and pry up and hold that bad boy wide open to give them room to work.

At this point some of the leads for the various monitors start falling off because the adhesive on them frankly sucks, and the CRNA kept losing vitals. Now if you know your basic anatomy, the stomach is on the left side of the body. So is the heart. So is the gaping hole the doctor put in the patient's chest to see his heart. Solution- I get told to keep pulling on patient's ribs, while also watching his heart to make sure it keeps beating.

Roughly 1515(ish)-I watch it slow down.

I watch it stop.

I immediately yell at the doctors that his heart stopped. One doctor reaches his hands into the patient's chest, tells me to put my hands over his, feel how he is squeezing the heart to beat it for the patient, pulls his hands out, and tells me don't stop until they tell me to.

1535- doc calls it and pronounces him. I pull my hands out of his chest and calmly ask if they need help cleaning up the deceased and resetting the OR. I get told no, it's fine, get cleaned up and head back to the ER. I break scrub, get cleaned up, and calmly walk out of the OR. Once the door closes behind me it hits me. I run outside to the smoke shack, start crying, and try to light up a cigarette but my hands are shaking so bad I can't flick my lighter. A buddy comes out, lights my cigarette for me, and just holds me until I stop crying and shaking. I head back in and finish my shift, got a job to do.

Fast-forward to once I'm home. Daily flashbacks to that day and other traumas, other patients, lots of gory shit, life sucked. Wouldn't leave my apartment, smoked too much, drank too much, just was in a dark place. One day after going to the shooting range I'm at home, cleaning my guns, I load and chamber my 45, and put it in my mouth, ready for everything to stop. The only reason I didn't is I didn't want my girlfriend to have to come home from work and find the mess. Wake up call. I get help through the VA. Counseling, meds, more counseling, more meds, shit got better. Still took years before I could tell this story beyond a small, very close circle. Even longer before I could tell it without flashbacks. But it got better, slowly but surely. 

Fast-forward some more. Now I'm happy, healthy, married (different woman from the girlfriend I didn't want to find me dead, much better model, I'm a lucky man), kids, a good job, life is good. Still on the meds, but that's become a lifetime thing (apparently trauma can trigger bipolar disorder if you're predisposed to it, who knew?)

Things do get better, I promise. It's a fight, a long fight, a hard fight, but they do. If you're struggling call someone, text someone, email, send damn smoke signals, but please, reach out. The end is the end, not a solution. We all want you here. Have hope. Be strong, be well. I don't personally know anyone on here, but I love you all. Thanks for listening, and happy veterans day.","5256"
"143","A few years ago, my brother told me this story. I can’t quite recall every detail, but I do believe he was something-Sergeant at the time. (Master? Staff?)

One of the new guys was being annoying. As in, causing a ton of issues. At one point, my brother ends up getting involved on the questioning side when things got heated enough something needed to be done. Well, up until my brother got there, the guy refused to give any proper responses (who else was involved, how he snuck in this or that, etc).

So, my brother just sat there in silence. 

Pure. Silence. Not moving. Not glaring.

“By the third hour he was unsettled. His eyes were everywhere. He went from nervous looks to breaking down like an old engine. I wasn’t done.”

At last, 7 hours or so pass. The guy looks ready to pass out. One of the men outside knocks on the door, my brother steps out. They ask if he’s hungry. My brother sees what it is, and his eyes shine. He tells them to come back in a few hours. 

Brother comes back in with a blank face, then finally breaks the silence with a smile. “You want some donuts?”

“Uh… uh! Uh, yeah, yeah!”

Newer guy looks relieved, but clearly still nervous. Brother’s face fell. Goes blank again. Queue another 4 something hours of silence.

Brother steps out. Steps back in. Puts box of donuts on the table.

By now the guy was shaking. See, my brother is a bit… unique. He had a reputation (I will post about the “Not-water balloons” and “The Wake-Up stick” after the three day wait). So, with this new variant in the equation, the new guy seems to get something is not right.

After 11 hours of silence being stared down by an Army superior that spent a decade in Iraq and Afghanistan, I don’t blame him. (Bro has also had a blood feud with raccoons…)

My brother goes on to say, “The tears in his eyes are shining. He is thirsty, needs to piss, and *sohohohoho* fucking *confused.* At this point, I knew it was time for me to do what I needed to do. I took a bite of a donut. He broke down crying. Didn’t get much trouble from him after that.”

From what I know, the new guy ended up climbing the ranks. Both of them still talk to this day.","5309"
"144","You're welcome. This is the sort of story that needs to be written, and probably, needs to be read. I was in the process of editing my comment, so I'll just reply with it instead:

Good lord, man. That, and everything else you must have seen and done, is an absolute shit-sandwich. But it's also clear, beyond any shadow of doubt, that you did everything humanly possible to save that fellow, up to and including manually beating his heart for him for *twenty fucking minutes* when it couldn't manage that task on its own.

Thank you. I'm sure there's people alive today who wouldn't be if not for the efforts of you and the other doctors there, and the ones who aren't, were beyond the medical science and equipment of our time and your station to save, no matter what lengths those working to save their lives were prepared to go to.

It's a very good thing you chose not to pull the trigger that day. *Not* doing so took courage, and a great deal of empathy for your fellow humans, to say nothing of yourself. I'm glad you're still here to tell this tale, gory as it is.","5438"
"145","Inspired by ""Ma'am don't call me again""

So my mother was a military brat. Several foreign bases including Saudi Arabia in her teens. She was then courted and married to an Enlisted man (my father), then traded up for an Officer model (my step dad) all in her twenties. Then in her thirties she had not one, but both of her sons join the Marine Corps. I was the youngest, so she had all this ""experience"" before I went to boot. She was going to lean on that experience to see me through. To say I was a momma's boy at that time, would be accurate. 

While I was in boot for the Marines, and for those of you that have gone, we were told not to be sent bulky items or food. So when a UPS delivery truck with a package for me showed up one day.....to say my Drill Instructors were pissed would be an understatement. Now, to put this in perspective, most mail is sent through the regular mail, and the drill instructors hand out mail to its owners, by doing what is called ""mail-call"" and that is when everyone sits school circle around the drill instructor and the mail is passed back to its owner as the names are called out. 

Well, we were not in mail-call, if memory serves me correctly we were doing drill and ceremonies practice when this UPS truck drives up to our barracks building, and then asks one of my drill instructors off to the side, what I assume was something like ""Hey, yall couldn't tell me where to find Commandant SgtMaj in the Marines AbstractWealth smuckatelly would you?"", because the way they screamed my name in unison sent shivers down my spine. Suddenly I am being smoked in the sand pit for my mama sending me a huge care package. Fun times. 

But wait, there's more to the story. I'm sure your wondering about the contents of the care package. The title of this story also hasn't been explained, so I must continue past the first round of being smoked, which is usually the punishment for getting these care packages, or food in the mail. 

 Later in the same day, we are back in the squad bay, and my package has been held by my Senior Drill Instructor until mail-call. Well he brings me up to the front of my platoon, and has me open the package in front of everyone. Well top of the box, a letter to me, and a letter to the drill instructors. Box is full of soaps, body washes, tooth paste, tooth brushes, deodorant, anything she could get donated from her hospital job, was in bulk in this box. 

I am told to read my letter aloud, which is cut short cause my mother obviously expected that so she wrote something like ""To all that hear this reading, you are loved, you are cared about, and there are mama's like mine that want you to know that we love each and every one of you, good luck on your journey, and stay strong, it'll all be over sooner then you think."" at which point I am sure I was told to start doing pushups while my Senior handed out the soaps and deodorants etc to all those that needed it. Senior passed the letter off to the other drill instructors and I never got to read it, and I've asked my mother about it, and she doesn't remember exactly, but being a Marine Mom, she had already done this before, and the letter pretty much was a thank you for sacrificing your lives and youth for the betterment of a nation that sometimes seems ungrateful, but know that the military family is as grateful for you as we possibly can be. I remember seeing a smile on one of the hardest drill instructors I came across when he was reading the letter. All the while I was doing push ups, and bicycle kicks, jumping jacks, and air squats just sweating my ass off. 

I was rewarded though.....see I joined when I was 17, and very quickly even with all the preparation, I realized I had zero life experience when I stood on the yellow foot prints, I was a scared child who was choosing to grow up, way too fast. My reward? My senior let me call and thank my mother. To say I wept on that phone was an understatement, but I needed to. My mother knew I needed to just be reassured, to hear a positive in the storm, to see that I was doing the right thing. She praised me quickly, reassured me of my decision, and told me how proud of me she was, she told me I could weep for ten more seconds, but then I needed to shut it off, and push forward, ten seconds to not be in control, and then I had to finish what I started. Its what I needed, and even before those ten seconds were up, I was ready. 

You see, a Mothers love, is unexplainable, and knows no limits. It will fill you with warmth, and yet can humble you in a heartbeat. I myself needed to know that my mothers love was still there, even though I wasn't, and my Senior knew that, he knew because of experience, and knew I needed that experience in order to continue successfully. 

Not all Marine Corps boot camp stories are semi-horror stories. This one, this is my love story from boot camp, a Love for brotherhood, a love for family, a love for a Nation, a love for ones self.

"147","Just came across this sub and figured I’d share a story from AF basic training back in 2013.

I was fresh out of high school, just turned 18. Scared as hell but glad I was around other young women who decided to join. During week 2, we were all lined up outside the dining hall for dinner when the mail came. It was the first round of letters we’d received since getting to San Antonio. Everyone got theirs then went to eat.

Next morning, lined up for breakfast, one of the guys in our brother flight was all red in the face. Eyes puffy and still wet from crying. As one of our SSgts came to do morning check in, he noticed trainee’s demeanor. He loudly asked for the reasoning, and trainee broke down in tears again. You could tell SSgt was getting worried at this point, maybe thinking he got bad news in a letter from home. Another trainee informed SSgt that his girlfriend wrote and broke up with him after 2 years of being together because it was “too hard being away” (which we all know what that means).

SSgt kinda smirked, walked in front of everyone, and said “well why don’t we cheer him up!” He then started singing “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” by Elton John. Prompted all of us to sing along. Then would point at the brothers to sing the male part and the sisters to sing the female part. For about 2 minutes, at 5:30 am, we became an awkward choir to help a heartbroken brother. He obviously got a kick out of it and was smiling for the rest of the day (when permitted, of course). 

From what I heard, SSgt pulled him aside later and gave him some much needed words of encouragement. I felt super lucky to have a good group of SSgts and TSgts who did their best not to make us feel like shit at all times.","5601"

"150","Howdy y'all! The continuing saga of the Katrina stories continue.

Background: I was the Command Master Chief (CMC/E9) at Coast Guard Air Station (CGAS) New Orleans (NOLA) when Hurricane Katrina hit.  My job when a hurricane was forecast to  hit the eastern gulf coast was to depart New Orleans and drive to Naval Air Station (NAS) Meridian, MS (approximately 200 miles) were I was acting as the Coast Guards liaison to the Navy. NAS Meridian is where Coast Guard families and units evacuate to when a storm is forecasted to hit them. To the story.

The job was pretty cushy after everyone was checked in and hunkered down.  When the storm hit and even though we were 200 miles inland it still packed a wallop.  Lots of wind, lots of rain, lots of downed trees... everywhere. Roads were closed, including the interstate highway leading to New Orleans. After the first day we started to hear rumors of how bad things were in NOLA. On the 3rd day after the storm a special CG unit decided to return to NOLA since they were able to not only transport the crew but their boats as well.  This was not a normal unit.  Think of them as a waterborne SWAT Team. Special boats, special weapons, the whole nine yards. On their way back we heard they were waylaid by armed civilians who wanted their equipment. Imagine their surprise when 30 or so guys and gals popped up pointing tactical weapons back at them. In other words it wasn't safe to travel.

Meantime, I was considering myself pretty lucky. I had electricity, food, a great place to stay and a pretty cushy job. I even bought a portable generator for when I eventually went back On the third day in the afternoon I got the call. It was very broken, and took three tries as the calls dropped but the gist of the message was I was needed at Homeplate.  Come home. OH SHIT!

I sure don't want to drive through Indian country! Especially with a brand new generator! It was solid gold in a place with no power! What to do?  Then I heard of a group of E-9's that were heading to CGAS Mobile, AL the next morning in an RV.  As one of the E9s was the 8th CG Districts CMC, and we were friends anyway, it was no problem catching a ride.

The next morning I said goodbye to my BOQ Room, my SUV, and my friends and with generator in tow, left for Mobile. It took us all day to drive that \~130 miles but we made it just as supper was being served. But I decided to check in with flight ops to see if I could catch a flight from Mobile to NOLA.

I was told sorry Master Chief but the last flight just left. Check in tomorrow.  I said Great! I'm heading to the chow hall.  I made it about 50 steps before I was called back.  I was asked by a LT in flight ops of I was MCPO Radiant-Art, CMC of CGAS NOLA? I said yeah, why? I was told stay here and where are my bags? I was told that they had recalled the last flight out to pick me up. Huh? WTF is going on? I told them where my stuff was and they told a kid to go get them. I told them I had a generator with me so they better send 3 people. I had just been introduced to my new reality.

The HU-25 picked me up and we somehow got the generator and my gear onto the most unsafely packed full jet I had ever seen.  Cargo was stuffed everywhere! Off we went. We flew along the gulf coast, over scenery that I had been flying over for 15 years. I didn't recognize it all with all the damage.

We landed at dusk and due to the air traffic and congestion at NAS Belle Chasse, we were directed to park on a taxi way. It took me an hour to walk to the CGAS. What I saw was our security gate wide open, 60 or so feet of our hangar roof torn off, trees laying across our perimeter fence, and a shitload of unfamiliar faces. Along with more helicopters than I had ever seen in one place before. My 60 man crew had ballooned to over 200!

When I walked to the Admin building at about 2000, which is where my office was located, I was shocked! As soon as I walked in the door I had to start stepping over people who were wall to wall sleeping on the floor anywhere they could find. I finally made it to my office to drop off the one bag that I dragged across the base and go find someone to check in with. I didn't take 10 steps before someone swung me around and threw me into a bear hug with a big I am glad to see you! It was the CO. After a few minutes of catching up I asked what he needed me to do? He stepped back and said I'm making a new position. You are now 2nd XO. You are responsible for everything on the ground except the aircraft. He went on to explain that he and the real XO were standing 12 hour hour shifts running flight ops (the biggest rescue in US history) and they needed me to take care of everything else. I thought OH, shit shit shit! I said OK. I told him Im going home and Ill see him in the morning. He said nope.

Base housing is off limits (where I lived), and he would be in bed in the morning. Where do I sleep? He answered I sleep in my office. Well I found a mattress somewhere (for the life of me I cant remember where) and after reconfiguring my office I had a mattress to sleep on. It had been a long day and I went to sleep. It was the last night I got a full night's sleep for a long long time.

The next morning I went for a walk around base to see what the situation was.  The admin building was a mess. There was grass all over the deck that had been tracked in. Boxes that contained clothes, equipment, and all kinds of stuff that had been flown in for relief was stacked in the three hallways that made up the small admin building. It should be noted that it was during this walk around is when I first was accosted by the Executive Officer from another CGAS that I eventually kicked out of NOLA. There was also shingles missing from the roof. Trash was everywhere from MRE's and other junk. The hanger itself was a 24 hour hive of activity. The problems started with 60 feet of roof torn off. The offices and lounges in the lean to sides of the hangar were off limits due to damage and black mold. Again junk, cargo. donations, and trash was everywhere. So much for the buildings.

The grounds weren't much better.  On top of the trees on the perimeter fence, the grass was on the grounds and softball field. It looked like shit.  I meandered back to my office, closed the door, sat down on my chair, put my head in my hands and thought, ""Where do I go from here?""

Well this ended up a lot longer than I intended so I'll stop here and pick up in the next chapter of the Katrina stories. Sorry. See you in about 3 days and thanks for reading!","5672"

"152","My nephew did some sort of computer shit for the marines back towards the end of the heavier fighting in Iraq, I think he was stationed in Dubai. He said he didn’t do much “war stuff” (kid was/is the typical pothead) but made a bunch of money off his fellow marines by guiding them towards porn sites that he knew were full of malware and then cleaning up their laptops when the viruses showed up. (So he says, this kid will lie to you if given a chance.) 

We were having one of those big ol’ Mexican parties with the whole famdamily and some folks that nobody knew and I was sitting between nephew and his grandpa (who served in Korea and had raised nephew). Garage full of tables/chairs, folks catching up with loved ones, drinking beer, eating like hogs, just a good little party. Nephew had gotten out already, stepson had gotten leave. Stepson finally showed up with his side piece of the week, says his hello’s, and asks nephew to come out to the driveway, wants to show him something. Nephew doesn’t want to, gramps tells him to go on, it might be important. There was no yelling, no raised voices, nothing. Stepson dropped his cousin right there in the driveway with an overhand right and walked inside and grabbed a beer and sat down where nephew was sitting. Everyone was all pissed off, yelling at the kid, all he would say was “He might tell you guys when he wakes up. It’s over now, and I ain’t saying shit”. 

Anyway, my stepson had signed up later than him and was about halfway through mcrd San Diego when he got a package in a similar manner to op. Yep, the kid got to open a package containing a giant pink plastic dick in front of everyone at mail call and then get smoked, on top of catching hell from the other recruits. And he didn’t forget who caused it.","5830"
"153","This one's going out in support of Movember

TLDR: Mind your mental health . . . and loyalty is a two-way street.

Master Sergeant (MSG) Bobby was one of my first real mentors in the Army. He was Special Forces and had been a Tomb Guard. For a green troop like I was then, he was pretty damned impressive just on reputation alone. More-so once I got to know him.

For whatever reason, he took a liking to me back when I had barely enough rank to hold my collar down. He became a constant source of guidance and encouragement. He pointed me in directions I didn't even know I needed to go in. He shaped a lot of my professional Army activities as a junior ranking soldier and later on as a buck Sergeant, giving me a great foundation to stand on when I went up for Officer Candidate School (OCS).

Among other things, I learned about loyalty from MSG Bobby, and sticking together through hardship. It was through my relationship with him that I came to understand how loyalty really works. He taught me that loyalty is a two-way street, that the best way to earn it and receive it from others was to display it and give it yourself.

As it happens with so many in the military, MSG Bobby was not a saint and could be ""less than impressive"" regarding his home life and in his close relationships. His wife decided one day that she'd had enough of him, his demons, military life, and all the rest, and she left him. Sally hired a *stellar* divorce attorney and pretty much took MSG Bobby for everything he had. I've seen a bunch of divorces, both in my own family and in the military, and I've got to tell you this was a beat-down. To borrow from *The Grinch*: the one speck of food that she left in the house was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse. Seriously, girl took it *all*.

During this time, I walked alongside MSG Bobby through his landscape of personal destruction and an interesting change took place. We went from him showing me the way on my military career, to me helping him navigate his journey of despair. I'd experienced my Dad walking this path more than once (more than twice or thrice, TBH) so I guess I had something to offer.

Sally was ruthless - she took everything that she wanted from MSG Bobby on her way out the door, and then for good measure she took something more. MSG Bobby gave her, as the cherry on top of the divorce fiasco, his sanity.

He was there at the unit one day, his usual self, and then I didn't see him for a few days. I asked around the battalion and finally found out where he'd disappeared to: MSG Bobby went to the Psych Ward at Tripler Army Hospital where he got in-patient treatment for about 90 days. I hadn't known how bad it was for him - he kept that part hidden even from me - but he made the life-or-death death decision to get professional psychological help. If he hadn't made that choice, he almost certainly wouldn't be around today.

(side note: If you are suffering, **please** seek help. Many in the military find themselves in situations where they need assistance. I'll ask you: What do you do if you break your leg? You get it fixed. What if you break your brain? Same-same - you get it fixed. I know it's a vast oversimplification, but you get the idea. If you're hurting, please call **988** \- it's the nationwide Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline. There are other resources out there as well, so please-please-please find one of them and take a first step.)

MSG Bobby rejoined the unit about 3 months later and gave me a call. Actually, he called a bunch of people he'd hung out with, interacted with, or worked with before his 90-day divorce detox at Tripler. I was the only one who answered his calls. Really. Out of ***anybody*** he knew in the unit, apparently I was the only one who was willing to spend time with him. None of the others wanted to risk getting his mental illness ""stink"" on them. But MSG Bobby had been there for me . . . how could I do anything but be there when he needed me?

MSG Bobby found a shitty little rental up in Hale'iwa and I'd be there with him most weekends - playing video games, mountain biking, getting coffee, whatever helped him get back to being himself . . . Really I was just being there for him and helping him heal. He and I spent a lot of time together over the next few months before he PCS'd (moved) to 3rd Army in Atlanta.

A little while after he left the island, I found myself at Fort Benning for OCS, just down the road from MSG Bobby again. After Basic Phase was done (8 weeks into the 13-week program) all of us officer candidates were allowed to have a free weekend here and there if no training was planned. MSG Bobby opened his apartment to me on those weekends and I got the chance to relax and mentally recover a bit myself. Visits to his place in Atlanta were especially nice while I was in Airborne school for a few weeks after OCS.

On graduation day from OCS, my Dad (retired Navy officer) was there to give me my oath of office. My Mom and my Wife were there to pin on my butter bars. MSG Bobby was there as well, waiting to give me my first salute. I returned that salute and then according to tradition I shook his hand and palmed him a silver dollar. That coin was the most beat-up, scratch-and-dent, godawful looking piece of shit I'd been able to find, minted sometime in the hazy distance of the previous century.

Like I said, I shook his hand and thanked him for being there for me, then told him something I'd been working on and rehearsing since the moment I learned he'd be there for my first salute:

Me: MSG Bobby, this silver dollar is almost as beat up as you. All these other LT's are handing out shiny new coins, but they don't have any history behind them. I chose this one over a shiny one because I wanted to give you something that represents how I feel about you - it's scuffed up and worn down and beat to shit, but it's still worth holding onto. Every time you look at that silver dollar, I want you to remember what we've been through and how much you mean to me.

MSG Bobby went on to retire from the Army a few years later - he ended up getting married again and had a couple kids. He did alright for himself - something he couldn't have done if he hadn't found the courage to grab a lifeline a few years back. Eventually, life happened to both of us and rather unfortunately we lost track of each other, but I've always remembered the help he gave me and the lessons he taught me. I try to share those lessons as freely as he did.

I like to think that every once in a while MSG Bobby rests his eyes on that ugly-ass silver dollar hidden among the rest of his challenge coins and he's reminded of how precious he is.","5933"
"154","I was reminded of this particular story by my good friend &amp; mentor during our time at Air Assault School. Today I will be sharing my experience with the dreadful veggie omelet, Tabasco sauce and it’s effect on one’s intestines

Following a day of Tests and Repelling, we had one more task to accomplish before earning our Air Assault badge; A 12-Mile Ruck March. Our step off time was 1700 so out came the MRE’s prior to stepping off.

Now since this was a school it was the Black Hats breaking open the boxes and launching MRE’s at Students Heads. When I caught mine you can imagine the disappointment when I saw “Veggie Omelet” in bold letters. 

“No worries” I thought, I grabbed my tobacco sauce out of my ruck and proceeded to dump half the bottle all over the mushy, created in a lab, air sealed mass that somehow passes for food. I finish up eating and am eager to start the 12-Mile. 

Prior to beginning the ruck I began to feel a sort of stinging pain in my lower stomach. Thinking nothing of it, i drank some water and began the 12-Mile Ruck. The pain would return here and there but I just kept trying to focus on anything else. 

At about Mile 4 is the moment I began to feel like Mel Gibson on the rack in Braveheart. By Mile 6 I was clinching my ass hole to the point I feared I would create a void inside me that would suck me in from my ass hole inward. 

Half way through Mile 6 I couldn’t take the pain and uncomfortable fear that I would shit my pants on this Ruck. Unexpected by the Black Hats following us, I take off into the woods. I run through the woods until I could find a tree.

I find a tree, throw off my Ruck, grab the wipes, drops my britches, Lean up against the tree and unload a catastrophic nightmare of a shit that could have constituted destruction to the environment.

Instant relief comes over me. This relief was short lived by the sounds of a Black Hat running through the woods to find me:

Black Hat: WHAT IN THE FUCK………(his facial expressions indicated he saw the damage and absorbed the smell)

The Black Hat turned around with urgency and returned to the road. I grabbed my gear and quickly got back onto the road to continue the Ruck. Upon returning I am greeted by the gagging sounds of the Black Hat. Tears in his eyes, he’s able to muster enough strength to mutter “We’ll address this after the Ruck” 

Upon finishing the Ruck I am greeted by the Black Hat who I’m sure suffered some sort of nasal damage due to the smell emulating from WMD Shit I unloaded. 

What should have been a simple 15 min. smoke session of push ups and flutter kicks was quickly extended due to my laughter at the comments he was making about what he saw and smelt.","6049"
"155","Memory triggered - amusement at sea, dived...

One particular officer, who I remember very fondly, was in my (mine when on watch) compartment for a drill. His relief was also with us. In my compartment, there was a locker filled with ""educational literature"" which (we'll call him) Bob was searching through. Of note is that his relief happens to be gay.

Bob, searching through for something he hadn't already perused, looks up at his relief and says ""Nothing in here for you"".

Cue awkward silence, because nobody has a clue how to deal with a LtCdr saying shit like that, for a minute or so until Bob shouts ""Hold on. Here's some gay porn"" and throws a copy of mens health towards his relief. Nobody had issues on how to react to that - we all followed Bob's relief in laughing out loud.

EDIT: ""Bob""s relief turned out to be an excellent replacement for him. Learned the job well, and did it to the same high standard.","6117"
"156","My father isn't with us anymore, but I remember two stories he told me from his time in Officer's Basic in Kingston, Ontario (Royal Canadian Corps of Signals thankyouverygoddamnmuch) in the 60s.

1) One of the recruits was a diminutive sort from a province that didn't speak english as its primary language. So naturally, the DIs took this to heart and apparently made this recruits life absolute hell. Size jokes, language jokes, more size jokes, and then when all was calm and peaceful, more size jokes. My father didn't know him well, but remembers seeing him walk by one of the barracks with a strange look in his eyes, and a very VERY large knife in his hands.

A minute or two later, there was this all hell of a commotion with whistles and sirens. The recruit had enough and went hunting the principle DI, and it took  about a dozen MPs and other DIs to subdue him. Nobody was hurt thankfully.

2) Another recruit was whiny. Apparently, he whined about EVERYTHING: food, weather, clothing, the smell, the showers, everything. But never enough for the DIs to do much to him, but a few others had enough. So they hatched a plan for him to get some focus from the DIs.

So, one night, a few guys went to bed early, and growled whenever someone tried to turn the lights on in the bay. So, lights stayed off, and everyone went to sleep....until there was absolute screaming and crying.

The guys had taken a condom, and filled it with water, and taped it to the ceiling, above the whiny recruit's cot. Physics eventually prevailed and the homemade water balloon came crashing down, soaking and scaring the absolute bejezus out of whiner.

The DIs took him outside and apparently smoked him something fierce for wetting his bed, and waking up all his squad mates. Apparently, he never whined again.","6182"
"157","When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans I was the CMC (Command Master Chief/E9) at Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans.  When the storm hit I was at NAS Meridian, MS acting as the 8th CG Districts liaison to the Navy. I was the District Commanders representative for all the CG families evacuating to the base.  My 4th day there I got a phone call from the Leading Chief Petty Officer at CGAS NOLA (Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans) stating I was ordered back to home plate ASAP. So I went, which is a story in and of itself trying to go 200 miles right after the storm hit.

Upon arrival I was met by the CO who gave me a bear hug, stated he was glad to see me, and I was now the acting XO (Executive Officer who is #2 in the COC.) I was responsible for everything on the ground except aircraft. You must understand that the CO and actual XO were standing 12 hour shifts coordinating flight operations.

Now understand that the stations hanger was inhabitable due to damage and black mold and the only other building was the admin building that held the operations center, admin offices, medical offices, a training room, and a few other offices for a command consisting of about 60 people. There were now 100-200 people living in that building. My first night I had to literally step over people sleeping on the floor anywhere they could find space.  I eventually found out there were only 4 cots available in the training room for 200 people.  

I had no idea where to start (That's a whole lot of other stories.)

The Admin building was filthy. Grass clippings everywhere. Stuff being flown in (like clothes) just stacked in hallways. That first morning as I was walking around in a daze taking stock, I was met by a CDR (O-5) who was the XO of another CG Air Station. He asked who I was and I advised him that I was the CMC. He immediately laid into me about he had heard I was in charge of the building and grounds and what shit shape they were in. Nice to meet you Sir. I replied that wasn't he TAD (Temporarily Assigned Duty) here to fly? Upon receiving his affirmative answer I advised his position should be in the Operations Center, not in the hall. He didn't like that but left. Throughout the next week or so I had a few other minor ""encounters"" with him.

One day I heard a story about a buddy of mine whom I knew from a prior station who had gone from radioman to OCS (Officer Candidate School) and was now a butter bar (Ensign/O1). He was one of the unsung heroes of the massive rescue that followed Katrina. He stayed on shift coordinating everything for 18 hours+ a day to make things happen. He had gone for some much needed sleep and scored one of the 4 cots.

I heard a rumor that someone had gone into the training room and flipped him out of the cot so they could sleep in it since they were senior. I guess I might have tripped off the line a bit cause I was PISSED. I walked into the OPCEN and in the middle of the hustle and bustle of operations and made it known that I wanted to know who flipped the cot cause they were GONE. I might have interrupted everything by yelling but tough shit! The CDR immediately said I couldn't do that as was I just an E9 and everyone in the room were officers. I replied Watch me. No one would tell me who flipped the cot.

Over the next couple days I wouldn't let it alone. I wanted the asshole! At one point the CDR sat me down and tried to show me the error of my ways for wanting to do what I wanted to do. Told him to Fuck off I wanted the bastard! BTW my verbiage is very much cleaned up to make this G-rated.

At some point somewhere along the line I found out it was the CDR.  So in front of a full room of officers and pilots I called him out and asked him point blank if he did it.  He stated he did but.... I cut him off and said get your shit together and be on the next plane out of New Orleans and explain to your CO why an E9 kicked you out of the biggest rescue in US history. (The looks on the other officers faces was priceless.)

He stated again, you can't do that!  I replied watch me and get yer shit and get out! He stated I'm going to see your CO! I said please do.  So down the hall we went.  CDR knocked at his door and stated he had a complaint about his CMC (me).  CO says come in and tell me. So the CDR basically half yells that his CMC is kicking him out of New Orleans! He gives his story and I got a chance to tell mine.

My CO (God Bless Him) leaned back in his chair and said, ""CDR, I learned a long time ago that when my Master Chief speaks, I listen. Tell your CO I said hello.""

I often wondered how his career ended.","6232"
"158","Vietnam, Grandpa was senior NCO of a unit. His unit was suffering from a serious issue with VD within their ranks. From time to time a unit was so heavily hit with VD issues they were simply combat ineffective and this caused chaos for the mission at whole. Well my Grandpa was called into a meeting with his Colonel and a few other leaders.

The Colonel basically said he's been ordered from the 1 star they need to fix their VD issue cause its causing them to be combat ineffective. Some 2LT suggested they confine the men to post, my Grandpa said that would be a bad idea as it would affect morale...then my Grandpa said he forgot who came up with the idea (I suspect it was him, but he wouldn't want to admit to it)

Someone suggested ""lets sponsor a whore house""

The Colonel shocked goes ""Say that again"" to which the individual said ""Lets go out, find a whore house, and make it our whore house"" 

The Colonel was really put off by this idea, he didn't want to be a pimp...but then a Major who was a doctor spoke up and said that if they sponsored a whore house  he could have a few medics assigned to the whore house and they could test for VD and treat the girls as they got it. They could also provide condoms. The doctor admitted it was a unusual idea, but from a medical view point...it would probably help the situation.

To which my Grandpa then chimed in and said ""And we could offer them security, we can station a few MPs there and tell the girls if one of our boys start acting up the MPs will take care of it""

To which the Colonel then asked ""And which whore house would we be taking over?"" to which an individual (my Grandpa has never named him) spoke up and said ""I know just the one"" to which the Colonel ordered the doctor and my Grandpa to go to said whore house and see if a deal could be struck.

So my Grandpa and the Doc headed out to the whore house, they went inside and got ahold of the owner. At first the owner didn't like the idea, but that's because the owner thought the military wanted a cut of her money...the military didn't want a cut of her money, they just wanted her cooperation...in return her girls would receive medical care, and security from Uncle Sam...in return she provides the a safe place for the men to unwind.

She agreed, and the next day the order was sent out to the unit. If men wanted to whore out they only authorized establishment was this particular establishment, no one in the unit was allowed to partake in any whoring at any other whore house. It was this place, or punishment would be given out for not going to the proper whore house.

Well turns out things worked out pretty good. The rate of VD dropped. Said whore house ended up being very pleased with the extra security and medical care provided. Some of the men grumbled because they couldn't go see their favorite gal. 

After awhile the General found out a unit of his is sponsoring a whore house. The General demanded an answer from the Colonel why the US Army was sponsoring a whore house to which the Colonel is reported to have said

""You said I needed to be combat effective, I am now combat effective""","6333"
"159","can you imagine getting an article 15 cause you went to the wrong whore house? Boy o boy the media would have a field day with that.

Then the article explains the unit has a designated whore house for their soldiers to enjoy.","6466"
"160","Pretty much the same as happened in WWII at Pearl Harbor, and probably a few other times. The military quietly improves conditions and provides medical and security support to a brothel, soldiers are on the down-low *informed* that they *shall* use that brothel, none at all, or get in deep shit. And at all costs, the story must be kept out of the press!

Because Gawd Aw'mighty forbid people accept that human beings (soldiers included) *enjoy* sex, or accept that sex can be provided as a service without it somehow being a wretchedly godawful thing.

And of course, they'd be triple outraged to learn that the military, having recognized that having soldiers down with VD is detrimental to military preparedness, and accepting that preventing them from fucking is as futile an endeavor as preventing them from smoking, drinking, or cussing, takes the most practical course of action to ensuring that their soldiers don't all get the clap and basically absorbs a brothel ***to make it safe for the soldiers to patronize.***

The irony is, of course, that if brothels were *legal* and *regulated,* then the military wouldn't *need* to do things like that. (Admittedly that really only applies in places where U.S. medical regulations hold sway.)","6489"

Besides, any grumbling about any noise you make would immediately go silent, the first thing, after you report your back injury to the local corpsman. A blue on blue injury in an office space, over a chair would definitely create more trouble for the army guys than it would be worth. That army JO either has poor judgment, or he has a sadistically poor temperament. If he's willing to do the chair thing, what is his normal conduct towards his subordinates.

"163","He was  a PFC in my unit. However, no-one called him by his name. To us, he was just Dirty D.

Now PFC Dirty D was a peverted bag of hot air. He looked like an uglier version of DJ Quall. Skin and rat-like. This guy would make the worst sexual innuendos, look at women like he was in heat, and told the biggest lies I have ever heard outside of politicians.

When he lied, he said shit like his mother was a founding member of the Hells Angels, he was a former NYFD fireman, that he was a former undercover NYPD officer. The guy was 19 years old and already telling tall tales to make even the oldest of grandfathers roll their eyes.

He was, as I mentioned, also a pervert. Now, he wasn't an asshole like Ruckle. No, he was a different kind of pervert. He had more porno mags in his room than an adult store. The selection included women over 60, pregnant women, hairy women, and SSBBWs. If there was a magazine with naked girls, he had a copy of it. (I am not judging anyone who likes certain types of women, FYI) He was a regular caller of 900 numbers (if you remember what those are), he was a regular visitor at the cheapest strip clubs in town, and he frequented the local adult stores ALOT. he'd tell us, either we wanted to hear it or not, about his trips to the adult theater and watching a porno on the big screen with a dozen other guys. And he made fun of the others for being losers. He was a dirty guy. However, what solidified his nickname was one evening after we had performed a day long 2 day training exercise.

We were all tired and in need of some fun. We didn't want to sleep (even though we should have), we just wanted to go out and drink. So it was decided by a dozen of us to head into town and visit a local bar that didn't ID soldiers. You show a military ID and they just let you in and feed you booze.

We all had brought a change of clothes because we decided days ago that this was the plan after the exercise. Now there were females in our group, but we were all adults..... sort of. We agreed to change out there in the great outdoors and no one was to gawk at anyone else. So we started to change. Then it happened.

Dirty D turn his flashlight (the wonderful L-shaped ones we all loved) on PFC Brown and she was in only her bra and BDU pants and call out ""Nice jugs"".  Everyone was silent. He then smiled and said ""Thats why they call me Dirty D"".

Then Brown ran. Brown ran over faster than I thought humanly possible and punch him right in the nose. 3 times. She literally had his BDU top in one hand to keep him from falling and her other hand as a fist in his face. Brown was one tough soldier. Hell, she shotgun beers and chewed Redman better than any redneck guy in the unit. She was also a regular at the fight club and she was good. Well we broke them apart, checked out her hand, not his face, and then chewed his ass out as a group while he laid on the ground grinning and leaking blood from his nose to his mouth. We all took Brown out and paid for her drinks all night.

\*Note: A few months later I was drinking with brown and got into a topless makeout session. WOW is all I am going to say.

Now I want to talk about a specific event that led to Dirty D getting 7 days in the stockade and getting kicked out of the service.

I am sure all of us remember the little shopettes on post. Every base has them. Gas station, quick mart, and liquor store all rolled into one. One stop shopping for the single soldier.

Well, the one closest to our barracks happened to have a cute checkout girl. She looked like she was maybe 19 or 20 years old, blonde hair, and a nice build. A college student I believe. Similar in appearance to teenaged Michelle Williams.

Well, Dirty D got the bright idea to try and pick her up. How? By walking up to the register and instead of buying something, he slid an envelope towards her, said to call him, and walked away.

What did she do? She freaked out and called the MPs who came to see why someone had slid a blank envelope to a cashier. Inside the envelope (I got this straight from one of the MPs on scene) were several polaroids of himself nude. yes, Dirty D may have sent some of the first dick pics in military history. Also there was a note with his phone number and a message about how hot the girl is and what he'd like to do with her.

What none of us knew ws that she wasn't just an employee. She was also the sister of a Captain on post. A captain that was on a Brigadier General's staff. His aide-de-camp I believe. So you knew shit was about to fall from the skys.

After an investigation that lasted all of 3 seconds, they found several things to charge him with including, I think, Article 134. (I personally took him to lockup.) Well, either way, he got 7 days in the stockade and then was relieved of duty (aka SWAT or ROD squad) until he was official booted from the service with a General Discharge. As far as I know, he didn't fight it. I think its hard to deny that its you in a polaroid naked when you are the one who gave it to the Captain's sister.

Let this be a life lesson to all of us. Never send dick pics to the family of your superiors.","6527"

In our unit we had fellow in the motorpool who repeatedly tested positive for a particularly nasty strain of gonorrhea. He was catching it from the ladies at the local truck wash, $2 for a clean truck plus $2 more for a polished dick. Our commander warned him to not go there, eventually giving him an Article 15 for his trouble. Unfortunately for him he managed to contract an incurable version of the disease, ending up spending a month plus in the hospital in Saigon. As he told it the doc's had ""filleted"" his dick in order to scrap his urethra canal. It then proceeded to become severely infected. Guys reported seeing him limp everywhere, and to be drinking heavily.

The CO confined him to quarters and ordered that no one supply him with booze. A week was all he could take before he put a .45 pistol to his head and pulled the trigger.","6676"

OEF 2010

Camp Leatherneck 

Characters: Cpl Hotdog, Gunny Hotdog, Cpl Recon, LCpl Radio. The Hotdogs share last name, but arnt related. Cpl Hotdog is me, an armorer in a Wing unit, all the rest are in 3rd Recon. 

I was sitting at the DFAC(chow hall/lunchroom) chowing down on some delicious food, if you can believe it, some of the best chow I ever had was in Camp Leatherneck. I’m stuffing my face when I hear, “holy shit, Hotdog with a pistol only what kind of hot shit are you!” 

I look up and see two rockers on the collar (gunnery sergeant) and immediately start trying to get my chow swallowed to respond that I’m nothing special just a armorer. 

Well the gunny sits down and has a conversation with me about where my family is from, seeing if we were potentially related. Well turns out we were not, and we then pivoted to what they’ve been doing outside the wire(off the safety of the big modern military base). Well it was the Push into Marjah so it was a lot of patrols, firefights, and kicking in doors. 

We turn to weapons and I was shocked at what he had to say. Not having proper SL3(support equipment like slings, magazines, even your iron sights). Well me being a armorer, I had come into a previous units absolute disaster of inventory. And their unit left alot of their “deployed” gear so our unit had a excess of just random stuff. But one thing in particular was magazines and weapons lights. 

Gunny’s eyes lit up when I mentioned we had hoards of equipment laying around. He asked if he could have some, and we had a standing order allowing it to be redistributed but it wasn’t like we were putting it on marketplace. Like four people in the unit had a complete list of the inventory. I was one of them. I take out the list and he near about starts crying. Turns out they have been running on spares and bare minimums while being told that their requests would take months to fill. Meanwhile a wing support unit is sitting on a battalion amount of equipment, everything the Gunny personally needed for his platoon was in that list. So……I hoofed down my food and took them back to my armory. Now to say my sncoic threw a hissy fit is an understatement. Her exact words were “these are supposed to be traded, what am I getting in return”, in front of three combat test recon marines. I coldly said “we can trade the scrap, after the real Marines have what they need to survive combat”. So long story shorty, Gunny took three sea bags full of gear, batteries, slings, magazines, pouches, bags, everything they could carry. Then they left, two hours later the entire platoon showed up, and we helped them reallocate the rest of the equipment we had on hand. 

My sncoic didn’t entirely lose out, she still tried to write herself up for a navcom stating that this reallocation was at her direction and that she had sought out the most in need unit to turn the equipment over to. Mind blowing self serving. 

To Gunny Hotdog, I hope you made it home and are prospering now. 

Apparently we got no better with gear accountability.","6822"

"171","So, in my unit we had a young man who we will call Tony. Tony was a special little guy. First of all, he was the first Hmong individual I ever met (That I knew of at that time in my life). Secondly, he was small for an MP. He was maybe 5'6 and 100 lbs soaking wet. He was, what people call these days, a gamer. He had an accent that made him hard to understand sometimes. And Tony didn't have any friends. He spent all of his off hours playing video games in his room alone. 

Well, one evening I was walking down the barracks hallway and as I passed Tony's room, I popped my head in the open door and said hi. For the first time since I had known him, Tony wasn't playing a video game. He was just sitting on the floor looking depressed. I asked him what was going on and he told me it was his 21st birthday and he was thinking of buying a bottle of beer to celebrate. Asked if he had any big plans and he said ""No, just thinking about buying a bottle of beer."" I told him I'd be back in  2 minutes and I'd help him pick something. 

I ran to my closest comrade, call him ""Hopper"", and told him it was Tony's 21st, he was alone, and we needed to save his birthday. Now Hopper LOVES to drink. its what he does better than anything. Once I told him the situation, he ran down the hall, told a few others and told me to take Tony to my truck for a night of epic fun. 

So I rant to Ton'y room, told him to put on his shoes because Hopper and I were taking him out for his birthday. he was So happy, you think he was just told 90's Pamela Anderson was offering him a bj. 

We left his room to see Hopper and 4 other down the hall near the entrance chanting Tony's name. 

Hopper yelled ""Tony, is fuckin' party time."" 

He then looked at the other and said ""This soldier needs a primer!""

The guys grabbed a bottle of SoCo (I hate the shit. I'm a Jack Daniel's guy), tilted Tony's head back, and gave him 3 or 4 shots worth of the stuff in one big swig. Like a CHAMP!

Then we were off. The three of us hoped into my Dodge Dakota and drove into town and to the part that is littered with bars, clubs, and strip clubs. 

First stop was a very nice, clean bar. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being tux and tails kind of bar and 1 being burning barrel behind the Circle K) this place was an 8. Very nice and very attractive waitresses. Now Hopper had designated himself as Tony's ""Booze Guru and Master"" and was deciding the drinks for Tony all night. Up first in that bar: Long Island Ice Tea. 

Tony drank the first one like it was water and Hopper order him a second one. While he did that, I went over to a cute blonde waitress and told her it was our buddy's birthday and asked if she would bring him a shot and give him a kiss on the cheek. We haggled a bit. It cost me $25. As Tony was finishing his 3rd Long Island and finding it hard to stay on his bar stool, the waitress walked up with a shot of Jagermeister. Before she could say a single word, Tony snatched the shot off her tray and slammed it back like a champ. 

The waitress was obviously startled and probably rethinking the deal, but quickly gave Tony a peck on the cheek (grandma style) and walked away quite fast. And then Tony fell off his bar stool.

So we picked him up, performed a crutch carry, and left bar #1. Next stop: Strip Club.

As we left the first bar, Tony, spurred on by the weak kiss, started yelling ""Boobs, booooobs, boooovooooobs!"". So as good battle buddies, we proceeded across the street to the 2nd worst strip club in town. The kind of place with the 40 year old strippers with c-section scars, fading tramp stamps, and bellies bigger than their breasts. (I am not bashing any woman that looks like this at all. I love ALL women.) We get the the bouncer and tony drunkenly tries to remove his ID from his wallet. And fails several times. He can't even hold it in his hand. We had to squeeze his fingers around the ID so he could hand it to the bouncer. Looking Tony over, we had the following conversation:

Bouncer: he can''t come in here. 

Me: He's 21!

Bouncer: He's too drunk. He'll puke.

Me: He's too drunk for this place? Have you seen the girls in there? You need to be drunk to watch these women strip! (Again, not bashing them, but just trying to argue to get Tony in to see naked women.)

Bouncer: No! 

At this point two more bouncers come to the door and we are ""encouraged to leave of our own fruition. 

Next stop: Bar #2.

We get to the second bar of our journey after crutch carrying Tony down the road to a huge Irish style pub. From 1-10 it is a 7. Clean, large open fenced outdoor seating, and lots of beautiful women. We try to enter but the man at the door said no. He said Tony was too drunk and he' throw up all over the floors. 

Hopper told the doorman that Tony was a veteran drinker, a super solder, and had NEVER pukes a day in his life from drinking (All bullshit as far as I knew). The doorman said fine, but we'd have to sit in the outdoor area and if Tony puked, we'd have to clean it up and he'd have our asses. 

So we got Tony to the table outside (one meant for 8 people) and plopped him down. I went inside to grab the drinks. Diet soda for me (DD here) and 6 shots of tequila for Tony and Hopper. While ordering, I found 4 ladies who were partying together and offered them to join ""America's Finest"" and have a drink on us. To my joy, they except. I immediately decided I wanted the red-headed later for myself. Oh how I wanted her.

I brought the girls and the drink with me and ordered a round of drinks for the ladies. More tequila shots. Hopper saw a dark haired goth-ish girl in the group and immediately started chatting with her. After introductions were done, we all did a shot in Tony's honor. Tony did 3 shots in as many seconds, and then immediately fell out of his chair. And then puked. A lot. And then passed out in the puddle of his own vomit. 

Hopper and I immediately looked at each other and knew we had to act fast. Neither of us wanted to leave the girls, but a good battle buddy puts his buddy before himself. I grabbed Tony's legs and Hopper his arms and we swung Tony over the 3 foot fence separating the bar's nation from the sidewalk. We then hopped over, said bye to the girls, and ran down the sidewalk carrying Tony the same way we threw him. 

You could hear the doorman yelling at us as we ran down the road. We went for about 5 minutes until we got to the parking lot. I had parked on the 2nd floor of a parking garage. We decided to leave Tony with Hopper while I went upstairs to get the truck. I left Tony passed out on the asphalt and walked to my Dakota. 

I came back no more than 3 minutes later. And Tony was gone. All I could see was Hopper on his ass laughing as I pulled up. Tony was about ten yards away. He was missing his shirt and shoes, he was low crawling on the muddy asphalt, and he was laughing as he yelled ""Boobs! Bring me boobs!"". He then puked again. We threw him into the bed of the truck and after a minute or two of looking for his clothes, all we found was his shoes. I still don't know where is shirt went to this day.

I drove with the two of them in the bed of the truck. We got to the gate and the gate guards looked in the bed of the truck at drunk, half naked Tony and laughing Hopper. When they recognized Tony and asked if he was ok, we told them about the last couple of hours. As we started through the gate, Tony tried to stand, yelled something in gibberish that sounded like ""boobs and beer"", and then collapsed hanging over the bed of the truck. 

A few minutes later, we got back to the barracks and Tony and gotten his 3rd wind. He ran inside and straight to his room. We chased him, grabbed him, and guided him to the showers. Hopper stood next to Tony in the shower as we rinsed the vomit off his clothes (what was left of them), his face, and his torso. We then guided him to his bed when he collapsed. He slept wet and covered in a mix of wet, muddy, and vomit covered clothes. 

Hopper and I stayed up for about an hour laughing about the night and talking about the ladies we met. We thought about going back, but decided that Tony may have killed the mood with his vmoit show. 

He hit the hay about midnight. 

Fucking 5 fucking A fucking M! Someone is knocking on my door. Its Tony. He is as sober as a preacher on Sunday. He is bouncing around full of energy and thanking me for a fun night. I told him to set the fucking door and let me sleep. Next day I see Hopper and he told me Tony visited him at 5 AM too. 

Apparently, Tony burns off the alcohol pretty fast. The next day Tony was a normal as usual. 

So that was the night we gave a lonely soldier a fun 21st birthday and the night Hopper showered with a drunk Hmong man.","7221"

That's right ladies and gentlemen, I was stationed at Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD) Parris Island South Carolina. That is not a typo when you see two r's next to Parris. It's less Eiffel Tower and more repelling tower. There's no croissants for you, but there are a lot of push-ups and crunches. In fairness, I have been back in the area and it is much nicer since I've been stationed there. But in the middle of the 2000s, there was nothing to do.

  These storiss have some interesting details to them. During my time as a postal clerk, I would occasionally get pulled out to sit in investigations, Non-Judicial Punishments (Article 15/NJP's) and other things where I could be the scribe. The scribe is just someone who takes notes of the key things being said. As I stated in one of my other stories, I can type pretty well and this was something that most commanders actually liked. So even though I was a feild Marine by trade, I would spend a lot of time inside when I wasn't teaching a recruits how to shoot. Both of these stories happen at the same Battalion (unit) to people in the same company. The stories only have Personnel overlap to them. However, these are short enough to put together.

The Bullet and the beanstalk.

  This story happens when ""don't ask, don't tell"" was still a thing. Generally, at this point, nobody really cared if Marines were gay or not. Nobody really questioned anything and just kind of kept on with their lives, as long as nothing embarrassed the company or battalion. This story involves two drill instructors who were suspected of being gay, not that it actually matters, and what transpired on a bed. You hear a story starting off like that and you automatically think that somebody gets caught in some weird sexual position where they're hanging from some sex swing upside down and all the blood has rushed in the head. Or at least that's what I think of immediately. No I'm not kink shaming here. 
  
  Marines are generally known for their prowess with weapons, and that means adhering to all of the safety rules that govern weapons. In this weird instance two Marines failed to stay out of condition one, and would forget to treat every weapon as it were loaded. For those that dont know, condition one means you're ready to kill as soon as you take the safety off. I'll paraphrase here a bit but condition one is  ""magazine inserted, slide forward, round (bullet) in chamber, decocked and safety lever ON."" Yes I realize some weapons dont have a safety, so don't jump my ass.
  
  As the initial story went for this, the two were sitting on a mattress together. One was showing the other how to break down a pistol, clean it, and then put it back together. Sometime during this event they ended up lying down together. Now I don't know about you but I don't understand why you need to lie down to service a weapon. But hey maybe it's something I wasn't taught and I've been doing it wrong all these years. Somehow during all of this they forgot that there was actually one round still in the chamber. ""Accidentally"" the trigger was pulled and the bullet entered one Marine's left ass cheek, bounced around a little bit, and managed to find its way straight out of his.... yeah. Oh his beanstalk would never be the same after this.
  
  Of course the one who did the accidental shooting immediately calls the Provost Marshal's office (military police) via 911. For those of you who don't know, when you call for emergency services on a military installation it gets routed through the military installation first. Somehow during all this the story changed, I know you're shocked to read that. They went from they were doing that to the weapon accidentally discharged itself on the bed. I guess Casper didnt feel like being a friendly ghost at that time and decided to take the man's penis away from him.

  In the end the one Marine would be charged for having a weapon on base and not checking it in with the military police. The other was relieved of his special duty and once his rehab was completed sent back to being a fleet Marine. I didn't keep track of this Marines career after that, but I'm hoping he's living a much better life and the surgery on his penis went well.

The sex ring
  
  When you read the title you're probably initially thinking that this is going to involve military spouses, both males and females. Or maybe even a sex ring full of Marines. Hell, based off the last story, maybe you're even thinking that a Marine gets a ring stuck on his penis. None of those are the case here. No this story is far more clever than anything I could have ever thought happened. The ingenuity behind the people that did this was nothing short of amazing. But it also goes to show that there were definitely some weak spots in the security and *recruit* (people in boot camp but not Marines yet) squad bays. You read that right, there was a sex ring involving recruits. For those that dont know, a squad bay is a big open area with a bunch of bunk beds for the recruits to sleep on. 
  
  If you didn't know there are quite a few recruit training battalions throughout the Marine corps. MCRD's Parris Island and San Diego are where Marines are created. the major difference in these two depots though is that MCRD Parris Island has the only all female and training battalion in the United States armed forces, 4th recruit training battalion. Basically this means that the males train with other males and females train with strictly females. If you've ever been on MCRD Parris Island you'll know that the battalions are split up about as far apart as they can possibly make it. However, there are some other battalions on the depot itself. You have my old home, weapons and field training battalion, then you have support battalion, and lastly H&amp;S (Headquarters and Service) battalion. Support Battalion is where recruits go for a myriad of reasons. One of those reasons may be if they get hurt, which means they go to Medical Rehab Platoon (MRP) or Female Medical Rehab platoon (FRP). Another reason is that they're in the process of being separated from service, where they would end up going to the recruit separations platoon. Throughout this time though everybody is still split males with males, and females with females.
  
  Since there aren't that many female recruits they only had one FRP. Depending on the time of the year they may have multiple MRP's running. All of these extra little spots are also managed by drill instructors. So even though the recruiter aee not training with training platoons, they're still getting ate up by drill instructors as much as humanly possible. Officially it's the break drill instructors get around the one year mark. This used to be called ""quota,"" but I'm sure they've changed the name. What happens is drill instructors push training platoons for a year, go on quota for a year, and then come back fresh and ready to push through for another year as more seasoned drill instructors.

  Somewhere along this line though, the recruits in MRP and FRP were able to chart out how to evade the drill instructors. Ome recruit managed to jimmy the lock to a door open,  and leave it where it looked like it was secured but it wasn't. The next step involved the hiding of a sex mattress in a room with other mattresses. They basically lined the walls, and the door, with the other spare mattresses so that sounds were muffled. They had spare mattresses and a storage area because you never knew how many recruits were going to be in the platoon at one point. 

  Throughout the night firewatch (recruits awake looking for a fire, or more realistically making sure other recruits dont run away) would end up playing security. They would wake one recruit up from each section and go meet up in the sex room, and do what they do. While you would think it'd be hard for them to get money to pay in one another, they used other items instead. One of the items being used was cough drops, since that's basically the only ""candy"" recruits can get their hands on. Quite a few of them just did it to do it, which is fine too. Both the males and a females were having their friends send them condoms in the mail. For whatever reason, since they were in rehab platoons, the drill instructors weren't checking the packages as hard as they should have been. You'd have one or two condoms sent in a package and nobody would notice because they would be taped to something else. Since the drill instructors were only worried about certain things they never bothered to check envelopes inside the packages.
  
  This scenario went on for *months*, and they only got caught because, and I know this is going to be a shocker, one of the female recruits turned up pregnant. The recruit thought she had the recruit crud (""the nickname for the sickness that inevitably comes from being in such close proximity with all these different people"") and went to medical. Turns out she was a few months pregnant and she was now having morning sickness. Since she had been in a rehab platoon for a few months, it was quite interesting to find out that she somehow was pregnant when they were supposed to have no contact with male recruits. This led to the investigation that eventually busted the recruit sex ring.
  
  Since this was the third ""scandal"" (mail being thrown away, Drill Instructors and the bullet being the other two) in less than a year, the battalion was getting a rep. In the end a few drill instructors were relieved of their duties and sent back to be fleet Marines, with huge black marks on their records. Quite a few recruits ended up being discharged from service with bad reenlistment codes. This ultimately ended up leading to the female platoons being on different floors than the male platoons. Mattresses were no longer stored in rje squad bays either. Unfortunately I didn't get to see the entire fallout of the situation, as I left a go to my next duty station at that point.","7441"

Yeah, I'm not sure whether catching gonorrhea or getting your cock shot off *through* your caboose is worse, to be honest.

As for the recruit sex thing, quite frankly, the only force in the world *stronger* than the physical force that will be brought to bear against any person, place or thing standing between a United States Marine and his or her crayon MREs, is the desire of young people to ***fornicate.*** It takes truly herculean efforts to prevent this. Probably the pregnancies could have been prevented by just handing out condoms by the armful and making it clear that while they will absolutely chew you out so long and so hard that your ears will fall off if they ever *catch* you using them, things will go *far worse for you* if it ever comes to light you've been making the sex *without* them.","7673"

"184","*Originally posted in June of 2020. As always, lightly edited. Enjoy.*

Just a short, sad one.

When I got to Korea there was an E7 there who was about to retire. I liked the guy. He was an old school NCO, and he reminded me a lot of my father and uncles. He wasn't my platoon daddy - we had a great guy from West Virginia. But working together as a battery, you get to know everyone. The guy had been in Vietnam and knew his shit.

Sadly, his wife was divorcing him (goodbye half your retirement) and he had become an alcoholic over it. Having our own Class 6 (liquor store) at camp made it easy since he didn't go to the clubs off camp. He was already a ""drunk"" when I got there, but he got his job done. People respected him and felt sorry for him for what he was going through. So he was given more rope than he should have.

Then one day he was drunk at the morning run. No biggie - half of us were usually still a bit drunk if we had been out the night before. Drinking until 0200 then getting up at 0500 doesn't leave much room for recovery time. But at our young age - no problem. I'll run drunk, fuck it. Seeing an E7 hungover was one thing - drunk was another.

It kept happening. Soon, it was clear he was waking up early and hitting the bottle. I know he was getting pulled into the CO's office and chewed out. Then he showed up drunk to an afternoon formation - he couldn't stand and report so he had to be relieved by an E6. He was coming drunk to chow, missing formation - just all around fucking up. He couldn't be put on duty for the ""hot squad"". Etc, etc. He went home soon after that - I'm not clear if he went to ETS out of the service or if they sent him to a treatment program. Never did hear about him again. Once you get to that late stage he was in, it is hard to recover and get sober.

I hope he did.

I remember thinking at the time, watching his decline as I was just ""partying"", how the hell do you get like that? Sadly, my drinking played out much the same - leaving the service after being hurt and having my wife leave did me in. Four years of ""partying"" had set my tolerance pretty high. It was bad for a lot of years. Then I was fortunate enough that the VA sent me to an inpatient program. Got my shit straight. I give them a lot of shit for mistakes they have made and shitty care, but the VA has also done me A LOT of good over the years.

Epilogue: After a period of almost 10 years of not drinking, my brother passed away and I hit the bottle for a bit before realizing I don't miss it. That was almost 15 years ago. I rarely drink now. I talk about bourbon, but I have better things to spend my money on 99% of the time, so it is a special treat for me now and again is all. Hangovers are no fun at my age.

Isn't that odd? Sometimes your body just makes a left turn across a double-yellow line, and doesn't bother to notify you of the change in direction. Lucky, lucky, lucky.

Me, I just quit. Quit whiskey, quit wine, quit aperitifs, quit toasts to people's health, quit tokin', just quit. Wasn't voluntary, and I'm not sure my brain was allowed in the room during deliberations. I'm not sure ""I"" was given a vote. Evidently, my body sees things through my eyes too, and all of those intoxicating things get a thumbs down in the form of a roll of the stomach and nervous ""Yuck!"" broadcasted from toes to eyebrows.

What I said, ""Lucky."" 

Today is my birthday, and the SO just couldn't stand that I didn't want a birthday cake or something like it. She ambushed me this morning with some kind of pastry from a shop (a tort?), and my morning taste buds decided that a foreign pastry might just go well with coffee. 

Boy howdy, it did - *so much* sugar! I'm on a sugarhigh right now, and I can feel the dank areas of my body plotting a full-inquisition of revenge. ""From now on, the thought of sugar will make you fwow up.""

I don't know what to make of things like that. They are good things, in the long run, but I like to feel that ""I"" am in charge. OTOH, ""I"" is sometimes WAY out of line. I got backup with veto-power somewhere. Hurts my pride, but I can't help thinking that maybe it's a *good thing*.

Sorry about your E7 - I would say the blame was on him, if that was true. It ain't. He got sniped because his own body didn't have his back.

Glad to hear you have the same problem I do. Backup is uppity sometimes, but rock solid when all you can do is lean backwards. Your brother would be happy and proud.","8531"

So when he had to watch me piss in a bottle I asked him to do a bunch of shit. “Hey sarge could you turn the faucet on please?

Then I’d proceed to sing a little song to my little guy to relax him while I tried to pee.

"187","The U.S. Army has the Spec 4 Mafia that has its fingers into every aspect of its operations.  In the U.S. Coast Guard it’s the E-3 Mafia you have to worry about.  Often it’s an E-3 who has been placed in a very low level position that has a surprising amount of power, or more importantly information.  In the Coast Guard the three fastest forms of communication are telephone, television, tell a Seaman.  And so via the E-3 Mafia word spread that Lt(0-3). Nick had been passed over for promotion for a second time which meant that Lt. Nick was on his way to OCS, “Official Civilian Status”. 

The Coast Guard has its form of Golden Parachute for the officers and Lt. Nick had 90 days until his separation from service.  That was 90 days to find a civilian job, 90 days if he was living in Gov’t housing to find a place to live and so on.  Part of me was sympathetic for Lt. Nick, after all no one likes being kicked in the ball bearings.  On the other hand he was a lousy officer and he needed to go away.  However, for the next 90 days he still was a commissioned officer with all the rights and privileges that come with a commission.    

In the Coast Guard every six months the enlisted personnel are given their performance evaluations and Lt (0-3) Nick while he was on the way out of the service was my department head and my rating officer. I’ve always felt that deep inside a person knows how they have been performing and the evaluation shouldn’t be much of a surprise one way or the other.  But, when you review your evaluation and the immediate reaction is, “Jesus, fucking shit!  What is this?”, then there really is something amiss with the evaluation.  Yes, “Jesus, fucking shit!  What is this?” was my reaction to  the evaluation by Lt. Nick.       

At the time I was looking to be promoted to BM2(E-5) and as part of the body of knowledge and skills required of a BM2 I had to demonstrate the knowledge and skills regarding the proper maintenance of the Unit’s weapons armory.  I had been working with the Unit’s GM1(E-6) Skip for the past couple of months learning the task. GM1 Skip worked down the hall from the Bullpen in the Facilities Inspections Department along with BM1 Mimi, BM1 Wasp, and MK1 G-man.  They also worked for Lt Nick as they were also a part of the Port Operations Department.

When I asked GM1 Skip if Lt. Nick had consulted with him regarding my working to improve my skills and wanting to be promoted he said, “No”. This immediately got the attention of the rest of his department mates who looked over my evaluation and all said that it was bullshit and I should appeal.  So, I went to the YN’s in the admin section and requested the appropriate form to appeal my evaluation.  When I made my request a vale of silence came over the office as if I had committed a   faux pas and people were too embarrassed to point out my transgression. 

I went back to the Bullpen and began writing up my appeal.  I made my appeal on a number of facts and issues that I felt were not considered in my evaluation.  I had recently been awarded the Commandant's Letter of Commendation Ribbon for outstanding achievement regarding the handling of a grounding of a vessel in San Francisco Bay. Lt. Nick had not consulted with GM1 Skip that I was working toward BM2 and I had assumed the extra responsibility of maintaining the armory along with all its associated paperwork. I also appealed on the basis that I had been awarded the marks of 4 or 5 in some categories, but 3’s in other categories when there was a large overlap in the categories that were marked 4’s and 5’.  I also made a point of bringing up the float coat incident and my below satisfactory personal evaluation was retaliation.  

I had the team in the Facilities Dept. look over my appeal, they made some suggestions and comments that I used to strengthen my appeal.  As per the requirements of the COMDTINST M1000.2, I turned in my appeal within the 15 day period to the commanding officer, Captain (0-6) Mac and waited. 

About a week later MK1 Harry stuck his head into the Bullpen and told me that the CO, Captain Mac  wanted to see me immediately about my evaluation appeal.  I headed up to the CO’s office area and when I got to his office area I stopped at his administrative assistant’s desk, a Yeoman YN1(E-6), and as per military courtesy asked permission to speak with the CO.  The YN1 picked up her phone and via its intercom feature said that I had arrived as ordered and requested permission for me to enter his office.  This was all a bit of a production since the door to his office was wide open and he could see and hear that I had arrived as per his instructions.  

Captain Mac said something to the YN1 and she motioned for me to enter the Captain's office and as per military courtesy knocked on the doorframe and announced, “Petty Officer GooBlatz reporting as ordered”.  Captain Mac waved me into his office and motioned to the chair that was next to his desk.  He opened up a folder on his desk which I could see was my evaluation appeal.  “I’ve read and considered your appeal” he said to me without an introduction as to why we were meeting.  “I know that you have not seen eye-to-eye at times with your department head, but I want you to know that I support my officers 100%”.  It took a moment for it to sink into my head. “So, sir, if I understand you clearly are not going to change any of my marks that I am appealing?” I replied. “I support my officers 100%” was his matter-of-fact reply. 

Once more it took a moment to sink it, a bit too long for Captain Mac liking, “You are dismissed” he said.  I got up from the chair and began to walk out of his office.  “Oh, one more thing” he said to me.  I stopped and looked at him.  He pointed to his coffee cup, “Wash this out and bring me a fresh cup of coffee, black”.  For a second I thought to myself the gall of the man!  Then the Chinese symbol 危机 Weiji popped into my mind. The symbol meant danger and opportunity are intertwined, one brings the other. I looked at Captain Mac, smiled and said, “Of course sir, I’d be happy too”.  

I picked up his coffee cup, walked out of his office area.  In most buildings there is a small kitchen area where cups and dishes can be cleaned, but this was a much older building that must have predated WWII, so there wasn’t a proper area for washing dishes.  The only other area left open to me was the bathroom.  So I walked into the bathroom and washed the CO’s coffee cup in the sink. When the cup was all nice, clean and shiny I walked into one of the toilet stalls, closed the door and proceeded to introduce Captain Mac to the old Coast Guard tradition of Dick Swabbing.

I had never dick swabbed anyone before let alone a Captain, but I had seen other enlisted’s dick swab officers numerous times in the past.  I have seen dishes, flatware, beverageware, even a tube of chap stick dick swabbed.  All were jerks that deserved it.  I had come to view dick swabbing as an act by the powerless against the powerful.  Dick swabbing is a classic act of passive aggressive behavior.  If you are an officer and reading this thread, you have been warned.  Be nice to the enlisted staff. 

I proceeded to rub the head of the little Bosun completely around the inner rim of the coffee cup, the top edge of the rim of the coffee cup and the outside upper rim of the coffee cup.  The trick when dick swabbing is not to leave any short and curly hairs, or smegma behind as evidence.  I tucked little Bosun back into his locker, flushed the toilet and exited the men's bathroom.  From there I went down the hall to the coffee mess, poured Captain Mac a fresh cup of coffee and walked back to his office with his beverage.  

Once more I knocked on his door frame and announced, “Your coffee sir”.  Captain Mac waved me into his office without looking up from his desk.  “Sorry that it took so long, Petty Officer Smith had just finished running vinegar through the coffee maker to clean it out.  The coffee has a little wang to it”. I said, placing his coffee back on his desk.  “Thanks,” Captain Mack murmured as I walked out.

"190","When I first joined the Coast Guard in 1988 service members were forbidden to wear the working blue uniform anywhere, but at work. If you were commuting between work and home you had to be wearing either civilian clothes, undress blues or a dress uniform.  If you had to go off base on official business you had to change out of the working blue uniform and into either an undress blues or a dress uniform.  I found this all rather ironic because when dealing with most of the public Coasties were in working blue uniforms. When doing a search and rescue mission (SAR) or a boarding, Coast Guard members were wearing working blue uniforms.

As I said in the previous post I was assigned to the Marine Safety Office (MSO) for the San Francisco Bay area in the Port Operations department.  For some reason I had to go to my clothing locker which was located in a changing area in the basement of the building.  The building has a large basement area where the changing rooms, a large conference room and the mechanical rooms are located.

When I got to the locker area I found the MK1(E-6) Harry and BM2(E-5) Dan were forcing open locked lockers and searching the lockers.  When I asked what was going on I was told by MK1Harry that someone had stolen Lt. Nick’s float coat.  When Lt. Nick was not wearing his float coat, it was hanging on the back of his office chair.  Once more Lt. Nick dickishness nature ejackulated to the surface, he suspected that one of the enlisted staff had stolen his float coat.  Lt. Nick seemed to forget that the building was open to the public and that the door to his office area was always open.  So, it was not out of the realm of possibility that a member of the public passing by an empty office might be tempted to pick-up a souvenir, not to mention bragging rights on how the item was obtained. 

Now, a float coat is something of a prized item in the Coast Guard.  It is not part of the kit of issued clothing and equipment.  Float coats are purchased from a Unit’s discretionary funding and issued out to the crew.  They are either orange or blue, stitched on the back in large letters are the words, “U.S. Coast Guard” in retro reflective tape.  There are two more reflective tape bands at cuffs of the jacket so as to meet the SOLAS requirements for a Personal Flotation Device (PFD).  As you can imagine from the term “Float Coat” and “PFD” the coat is inherently buoyant.  They are also great at keeping a person warm and dry.  As a bonus the float coat is actually stylish in a nautical-military way.   

So, Nick wanting his fashion statement back gave a direct order for MK1 Harry and BM2 Dan to recover said item by searching the lockers of the enlisted members. MK1 Harry then ordered me to unlock my locker so they could search it for Nick’s lost float coat.  By this time I had been in the service long enough to know a thing or two, and I knew that Nick’s order was an illegal order, and that the MK1 Harry and BM2 Dan also had been around long enough to know that as well.  The only person who can legally order such a search was the Commanding Officer, hence I knew that Lt. Nick, MK1 Harry and BM2 Dan were way out of line.  I told the MK1 Harry that I would not open my locker so he could search it.  He replied that if I did not comply, he would force the locker open and charge me with Article 92, Failure to Obey an Order, and Article 134, General Article, under the uniform code of military justice.  Knowing that this was not the time or place to argue the issue I opened my locker which of course did not contain Lt. Nick’s float coat.

When MK1 Harry had finished with my locker I locked it back up and left the changing area.  Once out of sight I made a bee-line to the second floor and the XO’s office. The XO was Commander (O-5) Slobpuke who was waiting around to make rank and be promoted to Captain (O-6).  When I got to his office area I stopped at his administrative assistant’s desk, a Yeoman YN1(E-6), and as per military courtesy asked permission to speak with the XO.  I could see through the open doorway that the XO was in his office area making sure all the pens on his desk were perfectly aligned north-south, or something else incredibly important.  The YN1 politely told me that the XO was busy and I should come back later.  

It was time to think strategically.  “Ok” I replied.  In a volume that was not too loud, but could be clearly heard in the XO’s Office I said, “When the XO is not busy please let him know that MK1 Harry and BM2 Dan under Lt. Nick’s orders are pulling open people’s lockers and searching them.  The XO might want to step in and exercise some of that officer leadership before someone picks up the phone and makes a formal complaint to the IG (Inspector General)”.  The effect was immediate, before I could walk out of the YN1’s area, the XO was up on his feet and flew by me.  I for my part made a slow bell back downstairs and to the BullPen.  

As I was passing by the Operations Center (OpCen) on the main floor of the building I could see through the glass door an animated meeting of the XO, Lt. Nick, Lieutenant Commander (O-5) I-Love-Alaska-and-Everywhere-Else-Sucks (the head of Port Operations), MK1 Harry, BM2 Dan.  Also in the room observing the meeting were MK1 The Answer Man, and MKCS (E-9) Short-Timer.  

The XO saw me walking by and motioned to me to join them.  I walked into the room and joined the knot of officers and enlisted going over the earlier actions of the morning.  Presently the XO motioned to me and said to Lt. Nick, the MK1 Harry and BM2 Dan.  “What the hell were you guys thinking?”.  “He has every right to be upset!”.  Lt. Nick took two steps toward me and said, “Well, if the Petty Officer here has a problem with it, he and I should take it outside.”...The room went dead silent. 

It was one of those moments where in an instance a million thoughts flash through a person’s mind.  My immediate thoughts were, “How fucking stupid can this guy be??”  Followed by, “It’s never a good idea to double down on stupid”.  Followed by, “If this idiot read my personal file he would know that I have just recently been through Boarding Team school where a large amount of time was spent of hand-to-hand fighting, and I’ve also been to an Article 15 hearing and got off light, so I’m not going to be intimidated by that threat”.  

It was common knowledge that every evening I spent a lot of time in the gym working out.  Hell, I was probably in the best physical shape of my life.  So much so that the previous weekend on a double-dog dare a childhood friend of mine and I had competed in an amateur wet tee-shirt contest at The Elephant Walk, a well known gay bar in San Francisco where we tied for first place.  What was not common knowledge was that in younger years I had spent a respectable amount of time in Kung Fu and Judo studios learning and practicing those martial arts.  

More thoughts sped through my mind.  The foremost thought was that I was not going to initiate a physical confrontation with a commissioned officer, but if he laid a finger on me I would not be following the Marquess of Queensberry Rules.  Then, an epiphany came to me…I had a very good chance of beating the shit out of this guy and actually getting away with it.  In front of a bunch of witnesses to boot.  If that happened I would become more than an instant legend…I would ascend to the heavens, become a deity, and be worshiped by my fellow enlisted for all time.  In my mind I looked up skywards and said a hearty, “Thank You God!”

I looked at Lt. Nick, took off my put my glasses and put them down on the chart table that dominated the Ops Center.  In my most deadpan voice said back to him, “Why wait, here and now will do just fine.”  Instantly the XO got between me and Lt. Nick as Lieutenant Commander (O-5) grabbed him by both arms and pulled him away.  At the same time MK1 The Answer Man and MKCS Short-Timer jumped over the chart table and hustled me out the door of the Ops Center and more or less threw me into an office chair in the BullPen followed by the words, “Shut-up and don’t move until told otherwise.”           

I don’t know how long it was before MST2 (E-5) Jeff came into the Bullpen, handed me my glasses and said that we were going out to do some boarding's in Oakland, CA.  I looked at MST2 Jeff and told him that I was to stay in the Bullpen until told otherwise.  He looked back at me and said, “What happened is already the hot news throughout the building.  Lt. Nick is in the CO’s office getting his ass chewed out, and it’s not looking good for MK1 Harry and BM2 Dan either.  I’ve got my instructions, let's go”.  We stayed out past normal hours doing boarding so that by the time we got back to the building about 6:00pm it was more or less empty.  Lt. Nick's float coat was never recovered.

"191","I come from a non-military family. Nobody in my family including extended family ever were in the military. Nobody even runs or goes to the gym either. Actually, I come from a family of nerds, which I didn't realize until I got older.

My older brother had a computer that he hooked onto the TV screen to watch anime. He torrented a bunch of shows, more than he can watch. I was given access to it, and often just watched the automatic playlist of shows. It often played this anime called *Space Battleship Yamato*, which I eventually found out was about about space wars with aliens who also happen to look completely human. My brother turned out to have never watched it despite having it. It was just me, at the age of around 10 watching it alone. I had no idea what the fuck was going on - but it looked intense and dramatic. It was all in Japanese and I can barely follow the subtitles. My eyes were darting back and forth the TV screen. All I comprehended were the cool uniforms, spaceships, planets, blue alien people, naked women with long hair, and the soundtrack. Their soundtrack made me feel things.

When I hit 18, my parents enrolled me in art school hoping I'll get some sort of degree, any degree. I failed art school because I can't follow the instructions for art projects and often ended up in the wrong classrooms. One of my art instructors was this Marine with no filter, and he regularly said some wild (but funny) shit about the other art instructors. He liked making fun of me, but he suggested I should join the military. I didn't even know the military can be a career path. I dropped out, and joined the Air Force which I had no idea about but it sounded cool. When I heard of the Air Force, I thought ""yay airplanes, it'll be like my animes"". The filthy recruiter who I approached just fed into it more, saying it will be a fucking adventure. He got me to sign the paperwork and shipped off to BMT to the demise of my parents.

I somehow managed to pass BMT, even though I lagged behind. During guard duty at night, my buddy asked why I joined. I said imagined it was going to be like in the movies. He grinned and was like ""yeah you seem like someone who would do that"". An MTI stared at me intensely and then pointed out I blink one eye at a time. They eventually stopped shouting at me and started stifling their laughs instead. My parents didn't show up to my BMT graduation. I eventually got put in as a personnelis working Customer Support at the MPF, one of the unsexiest jobs in the military. It wasn't like anime at all.

Yet I had a grand time. When I hit operational, and for the first time in my life, I had muscles. I learned to love to run and play some sports. I got a permanent tan. People asked me if I am a pilot. Girls looked at me differently. I got laid, and learned that girls don't really look at guy's faces or care if he can't form complete sentences. I finally got a degree with the help of a very patient SSGT supervisor. I was deployed. Anywhere I went, I met others who were also missing some brain cells, and we roamed around the base like a pack of wild wolves looking for trouble. My career resembled *The Hangover* more than a melodramatic space opera like I imagined.

When someone asks what made me join the military, I think ""yeah, about that.""

I don't tell people I joined because anime.

I am embarrassed you guys....

"193","I met Jessie 1989 when I was a Seaman (SN/E-3) at the Coast Guard Air Station in Barbers Point, HI.  I was a transfer from a 95ft Cape Class Patrol Boat stationed on the Big Island of Hawaii .  The 95 footers were getting long in the tooth, parts were getting hard to find and so they were being slowly decommissioned and being replaced by 110ft Island Class Patrol Boats. 

As a SN with actual sea time I had a fair amount of manna points among the officers and enlisted staff at the AirSta and thus I was spared being sent immediately into the galley to be a mess attendant aka mess bitch.   When my time came to be a mess bitch, Jessie, a Substance Specialist Third Class (SS3), now renamed Culinary Specialist (CS3) i.e. cook, was one of the staff members that I interacted the most with.  

As a mess attendant/bitch your job is kitchen sanitation. That means scrubbing pots, and pans.  Washing an avalanche of dishes at meal times, mopping the decks of the galley and mess deck and other cleaning duties as needed.  For the mess bitch their first introduction to most of their fellow shipmates is in the scullery where crew members pass their dirty dishes to the mess bitch for washing, sanitation, drying and stowing away.  

It’s a tradition in the Coast Guard to harass and generally fuck with mess bitch as much as possible.  Most people who came straight from boot camp are assigned to be a mess bitch the moment they report aboard a ship. Over the course of meal service, especially the evening meal, everyone comes to the mess deck to eat and eventually to the scullery to have their dishes washed.  When a new face is noticed in the scullery the cry goes out across the mess deck, “New Mess Bitch!”.   

Some people are friendly and take a moment to say “hello, and welcome aboard”.  Still others take their time at the scullery to be complete dicks. They got harassed when they were the new face in the scullery and so they feel that they are passing on the tradition.  Like I said, complete dicks.  The treatment by the cooks of the mess bitch could vary from person to person.  Some were cool, others dicks.

Jessie was a few years older than the average third class petty officer.  He had a four-year college degree in theater arts from Southern Illinois University (a four year degree for a junior enlisted person is a rarity in the USCG), and had worked in Hollywood for a couple of years trying to become a successful actor.  When that didn’t pan out he joined the Coast Guard.  Being more mature Jessie did not subscribe to the harassment of the mess attendants and harassment in general.  If the bullshit got too bad Jessie would step in and tell the harasser to knock it off. 

Cooks and mess attendants work long hours in the Galley, often 12 to 16 hour days.  By tradition cooks only worked three day on and are off for three days and stand no duty.  Jessie loved the idea only working six months out of the year, and no duty days were just an added bonus.  Mess bitches also didn’t stand any watches or have other duty days, but they worked everyday for 30 days straight.  No days off.  Welcome to the Coast Guard…BITCH!!

After I completed my time in the Galley as a mess bitch Jessie and I would often hang out together.  Many evenings were spent at the beach, which was only a three minute walk from the AirSta, drink beer, watch the in-coming waves and talking about life.  Jessie was generally hammered by about 9:00pm and we would walk back to the barracks and call it an evening.  The next morning Jessie was always in clean cook’s whites with his trademark great big smile, a great attitude and ready to cook.  How he did it I don’t know. The couple of times I got drunk I was always worthless and surly until at least 2:00pm.

Jessie’s drinking eventually got the better of him.  In less than a month he racked up two alcohol-related incidents.  On the second, I was on watch at the OpCen when I got the call from the Navy Master at Arms that Jessie was in custody for operating a vehicle while intoxicated which resulted in him rolling a car.  Jessie was uninjured, but from our conversation he was obviously drunk and he knew that his time in the Coast Guard was over.  I called for our Petty Officer of the Day and passed on the information, make the appropriate log entries in the duty log and wondered what the fuck was Jessie thinking.  The Coast Guard operates fast when it wants to and Jessie was processed out of the service and was gone in two days.  I didn't get a chance to say goodbye. 

Fast forward 2.5 years and I am assigned to the Marine Safety Office (MSO) San Francisco. I had become a third class Boatswain's Mate and was working out of rate and really enjoying the work an MSO offered.  I was living east of San Francisco in the east bay town of El Sobrante, CA.  One day I stopped in at a mom and pop hamburger stand called, *The Red Onion,* which I had passed by a number of times.  *The Red Onion* was a classic California hamburger stand that was stuck in the late 1950s early 1960’s with its architecture, décor and style.  Wanting a hamburger and wanting to try a local place I walked into the, *The Red Onion,* and O…M…G, it’s Jessie at the grill!  Jesus, it’s a small world.

“Jessie” I said, ""how the hell are you!?!""  Jessie turned around and looked at me. I could see he could remember my face, but couldn’t recall my name.  It didn’t matter to me, I was glad to see an old friend.   It wasn’t long before we renewed our friendship and we were hanging at his place or mine.  Jessie has managed to find a girlfriend, Susan, she was 6ft 4in tall, weighted 200lbs, shoulders like an NFL linebacker and had 44DD’s.  My civilian roomie and I called her *Sue the Amazon Love Goddess*.  Jessie had moderated his drinking, but he still drank too much. 

Jessie was the kind of guy that if you needed help he was over as fast as possible and expected nothing in return. With his training as an actor he was great at telling a story complete with facial expressions and hand movements.  He was always ready to have fun, and that great big smile never seemed to leave his face.   

One day Jessie’s sister was in town to visit.  She was really a nice person and me and my roomie got to talk to her about Jessie and asked about some of his odd behaviors.  Boy, did we learn a thing or two.  Turns out that Jessie and his siblings had a childhood that you wouldn’t wish on your worst enemy.  Even by the permissive attitude of the late 1960’s and early 1970’s if the authorities would have known what their parents were doing they would have taken the kids away.  It still pisses me off to know that it was a regular practice for Jessie’s parents to tape their kids hands and feet together and lock them in a closet while they went out drinking and partying.  

One day Sue had had enough of Jessie’s drinking and ended the relationship.  She picked up her gear and moved to Hawaii.  Jessie was devastated, but instead of turning to the bottle for comfort Jessie went on a marathon bike trip.  While on this trip he came to realize one major thing, he was an alcoholic.  Right then and there Jessie gave up the booze and became an avid bicyclist. Jessie had addictive behavior issues, but all things being said being addicted to bicycling is a far better addiction to have than many other vices that are out there.

Jessie started to pick up the pieces of his life and move on.  He got himself an apartment, he worked steadily at the *The Red Onion* and in his off hours was learning how to become a bicycle mechanic.  Things were looking up.  Then one day someone introduced Jessie to crystal meth…fuck! 

A person couldn’t fall off of a cliff faster and harder then Jessie did once he was turned on to crystal meth.  It was like someone strapped a rocket pack to his back, bent him over the cliff and pulled the starter cord.  In less then a month Jessie was unemployed and on the street.  His bicycle mechanic apprenticeship was over, he was kicked out of his apartment.  He reached out to people for a place to stay, but you can’t help a person on meth when they are not willing to give up that mother fucker of a demon.  In the U.S. military it is beaten into your head from day one that you *never* abandon your comrades.  It was one of the hardest things for me to say “no’ to him, both as his friend and as a shipmate.  

About eight months went by and one day Sue was back in town visiting friends. She found Jessie in a deplorable state on the floor of someone's house.  She took pity on Jessie, she literally slung his emaciated 5ft 4in frame over her shoulder and walked off with him.  She paid for both of them to go to Hawaii where she helped him to kick meth.  Jessie for his part got a job working as a cook and Jessie and Sue lived together for a number of years.

Fast forward 25+ years, it’s 2017 and I’m working as a civil servant near Jessie’s hometown of Martinez, CA.  One day I find myself thinking about Jessie and whatever became of him and Sue.  Well, with the help of the information superhighway and Google it only took me a few minutes to find Jessie.  The first article I found about Jessie was an obituary. I thought it was a mistake and then I found a newspaper article and finally the police report.  

I had to step away from my desk and take a walk on a hot California summer’s day.  While walking down Concord Blvd memories of Jessie flooded my mind.  Yeah, I got emotional and I’m not going to apologize for it.  

Jessie had been killed in 2012 by a 16 year old driver who fell asleep at the wheel of a car.  The driver was with her mother and she was on a learners permit.  Jessie was riding his bike on the first day of a multi-day bicycle ride.  I bear no anger against the 16 year old person who was driving the vehicle at the time of the accident, or her mother.  Having something like that on a person's conscience must be a horrible thing. For both her and her mother I wish them peace.   

I’m now older than Jessie was at his death.  I have all the things in my life that Jessie wanted so badly for himself; a loving wife, a child, a nice home and a garden.  Damn, life can be so unfair.  At his core Jessie was very good person who was struggling to swim to the surface of an ocean of shit his parents piled on him.  Once more I did not get to say good bye.  

I miss you Jessie  

I love you

"195","*Originally posted March of 2020. As always, lightly edited. Enjoy.*

I had at least one full division alert a month while in Korea. Most were drills, so they came late at night or early morning. A few were because of student protests against Americans – those were always in the day, and once was even told to us ahead of time. One day they just gathered us up and said we would be on alert the next day due to planned protests. That just meant we couldn't leave camp in case there was violence, despite the fact the protests never spread to the DMZ or the camps near it. The rest were provocations by the North Korean KPA – they would shoot at the South Koreans or something and that could happen whenever. Every time, the ENTIRE division goes on alert. A lot of us would roll north to our positions on the DMZ and wait for the all clear or for the first artillery rounds to arc over us – whichever comes first.

When an alert happens, you are expected to get in ASAP. Failure to do so can result in disciplinary action. No excuses, even if you are technically “off duty” and in a bar or whatever. After all, war doesn’t wait for you just because you just finished a 24 hour CQ shift or something.

I was on a two day weekend having no duty, and as most young soldiers are wont to do, I decided to party at the local establishments set up for us in the ville for just that purpose. That meant two things. Formaldehyde laced alcohol (which was all you could get back then in the local bars) and of course the friendly young women who worked those bars. So I did exactly that. Got drunk, picked a girl, and paid for an overnight visit.

I’m out at the brothel, actually in bed with one of said women, sleeping off too much alcohol and sex. Then the sirens go off. I’m sound asleep, dreaming young soldier dreams, when this whore shook me awake and telling me in her broken English that the sirens are going off. I woke up, heard the sirens, and started throwing clothes on. It was hard not to notice the little bit of fear in her face as she helped me out – being that close to the DMZ made the civilians nervous too, and they never knew if it was an alert or not. Hell, most of the time we didn’t know either. Command might, but us privates sure weren’t told.

Within a few minutes, I’m dressed and sprinting as best as my drunk ass can towards the camp gate. When I get there, one of the Korean contractors was on duty because all the Americans are on alert. He waves me through. I report to the armory to grab my rifle. The “hot” squad has already rolled out. They were gone before I was out of the brothel door. So here I am, standing in line to get my rifle, in civilian clothes, drunk as hell. It didn’t take long before I was accosted by one of the NCO’s. Before you could say “I fucked up” I was at parade rest, swaying slightly (and getting yelled at for that) and getting yelled at for being drunk while there was an alert.

When you are surrounded by several pissed off NCO’s, it is best practice to play dead. This is a skill all young soldiers should learn. Some don’t. The way you play dead is to stand perfectly still at parade rest, set your stare at a distant point, and just go blank. Wait. They will yell themselves out of it sooner or later. Then, they will either ask for an explanation (not likely at all) or tell you to “drop” and start pushing. (Much more likely.)

We had rolled out with drunk soldiers before. Usually, they went, were allowed to sleep it off in a vehicle somewhere, and given a hard time about it. Now, if you were drunk during the week and an alert went off, you could be in a lot of trouble for that. Not so much on the weekends. It was a weird contradiction. All of this despite the fact we had a Class VI store (military liquor store) right there next to the barracks. Here Adam, this is the forbidden fruit. Don’t eat it. By the way, you live RIGHT NEXT DOOR to the tree! We even had literal alcohol ration cards issued to us. What the hell? My entire year in Korea, I only saw one guy get in trouble for that. He was so drunk they couldn’t even wake him. So he got left in the barracks, and had an Article 15 waiting for him when he sobered up and we had returned from the alert. 

Just as an aside, we would drink up our rations of the good stuff on camp during the first couple of weeks in the month, then drink the bad stuff in the whorehouses later in the month.

So here I am, at parade rest, drunk and getting yelled at. I was actually asked for an explanation which they didn’t want. So as soon as I opened my mouth, I got dropped. Sometimes NCO’s will do that – ask you for an explanation, tell you to STFU, then drop you anyway.

After a lot of push ups they finally decided I wasn’t so drunk that I couldn’t go play Army with the rest of the unit. They had me draw a rifle and sent me off to the motor pool. In my damn civvies. I actually got into a vehicle with my squad and rolled north drunk and not dressed for the part. They let me go because they knew it was a drill this time. (Which again, the junior enlisted didn't know yet.) But had it been a real shooting war, I would have been with them anyway. I guess I would have been out there in jeans and a flannel shirt with my M16, looking like some kind of mad hunter from the mid-west or something.

Then we spent the next few hours in our position, waiting for the signal or the shooting. I was cold, not having a field jacket, so the squad was kind enough to let me warm up inside the track instead of taking my post outside of it. Thankfully, our position was a solo one - no officers to deal with or anything. By time we got set up and still hadn't heard or seen any fighting we figured it as another drill.

After all was said and done and we got back to camp about four hours later, I was yelled at some more. Which sucked, because now I was sobering up and it was no fun. I was threatened with some minor punishment such as an Article-15, and someone in the room vaguely insinuated I could be full on court-martialed. After some more ass-chewing, I was finally allowed back to my room where I took a 12 hour nap.

I wasn't drunk during any more alerts, but honestly, that was more a function of how it worked out is all. We were always drunk when not on duty.

At some point, someone decided it would be super if we were all getting randomly tested for substances we shouldn’t have ingested and therefore, it became yet another groan-inducing event that Marines walked into face-first when they arrived at the shop in the morning.

For obvious reasons, it was never announced ahead of time. It was always a gigantic pain-in-the-rectum operation, too, because Social Security numbers had to be verified, bottles of pee had to be handled properly without biohazard issues exceeding the normal threshold, and observers had to be located and secured before things could get under way in earnest.

The Substance Abuse Counseling Office (SACO) would notify command they were coming down and then the scramble would begin to nail down staff NCOs before we got away. Observers at Comm Company, where I was now assigned, were almost always staff sergeants or gunnery sergeants. Our job, to put it as tastefully as possible, was to make sure that the human being filling the little plastic cup was not pulling any shenanigans while their pants were around their ankles. If there is one way to make the average Marine Corps workday worse than usual, it is by forcing people to stand very close to other people and stare at their junk while they urinate. Not trying to kink-shame anyone who is into that sort of thing but, well, gross. I’m sure I don’t need to illustrate the point any further, but suffice to say, it could make my mornings really *stink.*

I arrived at work one Monday after receiving a phone call from GySgt Cosby telling me to skip my bullshit gym session and get my ass to the shop ASAP. It didn’t matter what I actually did for PT, to GySgt Cosby it was all bullshit because the man considered anything short of a triathlon a waste of time. The plot twist was that I hadn’t even gotten out of bed yet when he called, so I had to pretend he ruined my morning. He had already done that, of course. I just didn’t know it yet.

I dragged my ass into the dark brown brick building and, stifling a yawn, reached for the glass doors by the front office. Just as I was about to stumble through (I’m not a morning person, and no amount of beatings changed that), I realized there were sheets of paper taped to the glass. Blinking until my eyes focused, I saw what it was and groaned.

It was the dreaded List of Names.

The list was every Marine in the unit who had been randomly selected to come fill a cup for SACO. Approximately 80% of the list was of no concern to me because those were male Marines and therefore not my problem, as far as being an observer went. It was the surprising number of female names that made me want to hit my head against the wall. Great. As the only female SNCO on deck (at that time; others came and went in the surrounding weeks), that meant every single female would require my “personal” attention. I heaved a deep sigh and then went to find GySgt Cosby.

He was sitting in the shared room that served as our office along with 1stLt Smith. Gunny crouched over his laptop, staring at the screen as though it had been cheeky to him. Ever since he had returned from Afghanistan, he’d been what I can only describe as “spikey”. I mostly waited for him to speak and otherwise kept to myself. He grunted at me as I dumped my backpack in my desk chair and began trying to login to my own computer. 

Without taking his eyes off his screen, he snapped, “About fucking time, there, Staff Sergeant. Piss test starts in ten minutes.”

“Good morning, Gunnery Sergeant. I saw that.”

GySgt Cosby stood up and stretched, looking about enthusiastic as I felt. He glowered at me. 

“You look like shit. Didn’t sleep? Out drinking all night?”

“No, Gunnery Sergeant. I didn’t get any coffee this morning, that’s all. Or even soda.”

In a rare moment of magnanimity, he gestured toward the small refrigerator we all stored our lunches in behind the door. 

“There’s some fucking Diet Dr. Pepper in there, if you want one, Staff Sergeant.” 

Before I could stop myself, I mumbled, “I don’t want your old-man soda, Gunny.” 

We all teased him for drinking diet soda by the case, especially when it was a rubbish soda to begin with.

“You shut your whore mouth!” He clapped back. 

We stared at each other in shock for a moment, and then I burst out laughing. Holy shit, neither of us were morning people. All the tiredness and stress made me keep laughing longer than the moment really called for, and Gunny relaxed a bit, clear that he hadn’t crossed a line and neither had I. He threw open the door to head to the testing check-in area, and I trailed behind him, not entirely ready to do my bathroom duties, come what may. I tried thinking up a few ways to lessen the awkwardness while obeying the rules, but my imagination rebelled against such a vulgar task.

Out in the hallway, I leaned against the wall behind the testing tables and stifled a yawn. Marines began arriving and reporting in for their piss test. Down at the other end of the long tables, I could hear GySgt Cosby haranguing a male Marine for signing on the wrong line.  Slowly, my eyes started to close.

“Morning, Staff Sergeant!” 

“Yes, unfortunately it is.”  My eyes snapped open to see LCpl Harris searching the taped printout for her name. “Congratulations, you’re my first customer.”

LCpl Harris smirked, signed under her name, and then turned and took off her cammie blouse. Folding it neatly and setting it against the wall where it wouldn’t get walked on, she straightened up and waited for her plastic cup. I found the garbage bag under the table, pulled out a generic plastic cup and tossed it to her. I came out from behind the table to follow her to the restroom.

“Um, Staff Sergeant…” 

Harris shifted her weight and gave me an awkward look.

“Hmm?”

“The … other cup? Please?”

“Oh. Yes. Sorry. Fuck. Let me find those.” 

I went back to my station and looked for the *other* bag of plastic cups that were provided just for females. They were bigger than the normal ones because, well, there’s no way around it, females can’t hit a small target with their urine very well. I couldn’t figure out why they didn’t just buy big cups exclusively and be done with it instead of two different ones, but, hey, that’s why I’m only getting paid $2.76 an hour.[\[4\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/submit#_ftn4) I tossed the bigger cup to her, and then we proceeded down the hall to the head.

LCpl Harris walked in front of me so I could make sure she wasn’t, I don’t know, pulling some clean pee out of her pocket and putting it in the cup before I’d notice. She carried the cup at shoulder height in one hand, trading barbs with the males who were shuttling back to the tables with their full cups and the occasional worried expression. As we reached the door, LCpl Harris pushed it open with her hip and we entered the spartan bathroom.

It was a very military head. The tiles were the same color as pea soup, the stalls looked like they’d done more service in the Marine Corps than our sergeant major, the toilets were white porcelain with black seats. LCpl Harris set both cups down on the aluminum counter just below cheap mirrors the size of a notebook and began washing her hands. I crossed my arms and watched, pretending not to monitor such a mundane task. Once she had dried off, she picked up the big cup and went into a stall.

I pushed the stall door open and while Harris began undoing her trousers, I tried to make conversation.

“What did you guys do for PT this morning?” I asked, feeling a bit like a weirdo as she dropped trou.

“We played football, Staff Sergeant. The grass was really slick, though, so we didn’t play for as long as we wanted.” 

Harris finally got into the seated position and then locked eyes on the toilet paper dispenser and tried to carry on like no one was staring at her.

I risked a quick glance to see that her, um, bits were the place where the urine sample was coming from and then stared at the wall behind her head. Geezus, this is weird.

Once there was enough in the big cup to complete the rest of the operation, she set it on the toilet paper dispenser and finished up. With the cup set to one side, I had something to stare at that wasn’t another human being, so I watched it carefully in case it showed signs of wanting to leave the situation as badly as I did. Harris stood and did up her pants and then emerged back to the sinks. Carefully, so neither of us would have to do this a second time, she poured the pee from the big cup into the small cup and then threw the big cup in the trash can. She sealed the small cup and washed her hands again, this time more thoroughly. I hummed a tuneless melody to myself and waited.

She picked up the small cup, once again holding it over her shoulder, and we returned to the tables. There, she took a small strip of red tamper tape and placed it across the lid, initialed it with a black sharpie, and placed it in the cardboard box that was to be its home until the SACO pulled it for testing. I leaned over the list, found her name, and signed under it to indicate I’d observed her providing the sample.

“All right, you’re good to go. Thanks, Harris.”

“No worries, Staff Sergeant.” 

She flashed me a brief grin and then disappeared into the throng of Marines now surrounding the table. The next female came up and away we went.

“Good morning, Marines! One shot, one fill! Step right up for your clear plastic cup!” Snark was my only way of reducing a nasty job to a tolerable one.

After an hour or so of repeating this process, I’d seen the most eclectic collection of female undergarments outside of a fetishistic catalogue. Some of the ladies had even broken with tradition and worn male undergarments instead because boxers were far less awkward in their opinion than lace. Two hours later, all the females were done, and any appetite I’d had for lunch was ruined. Scanning the crowd and double-checking the list, I was pleased to discover that all the paperwork was correct, and I was off the hook now. Sighing with relief, I sealed the box that contained our specimens and then returned to the office. I didn’t have any work to do, but there was internet access in there and some sweet, sweet air conditioning, so it was my haven.

A while later, GySgt Cosby came storming in, slamming the door back, and tossed something in the middle of the floor. I looked up from my screen and stared at him in surprise.

“Everything all right, Gunnery Sergeant?”

“These nasty, cheating FUCKS!” he barked.

“Huh?”

GySgt Cosby pointed at the thing on the floor. 

“Can you fucking *believe that shit?!”*

I glanced down at the floor and once I saw it, I was totally confused.

It was a… 

Well, a… strap-on.

A strap-on with bright white cloth straps that, thanks to an internet search, I knew were for going around the legs and waist of a human being. There was a clear plastic bladder that was still moist from whatever had been in it. It was completed by a flaccid flesh colored penis on what I was hoping was the front.

What the fuck?

“Gunny, I’m not sure that’s E-O-kay,” I remarked while refusing to crack a smile. 

""Oh fuck off."" He growled and kicked ""it"" under the lieutenant’s desk.  “I caught one of the nasty little fuckers wearing that! He was using it to piss!” 

GySgt Crosby pulled out and screwed together a rifle cleaning rod from his desk drawer, and then used it to fetch the thing out from the dark recesses under the LT’s desk. Holding it at the pole’s length, he turned and headed back out the door.

“I’m going to First Sergeant’s office, there, Staff Sergeant. Don’t fucking come looking for me.” 

“Why would I-” 

The door slammed shut behind him.

For few minutes, I stared in shock at the wall. I mean, it was gross and obviously against the rules, but I was still surprised by the audacity and ingenuity of such a device. Someone really, *really* wants to use recreational substances unhindered—to go to those lengths. Then my horrified imagination started to picture what the female equivalent would be, and I squashed the whole train of thought before it ended in fiery cataclysm.

Well, that’s enough for one day already. 

I locked my computer and decided that now was a good time to hit the gym. Nothing cleared my head like focusing intently on how much I loathed running and, right now, I needed that. But first, a quick trip to the head.

"205","I have a lot of stupid stories like this, and they all play a part in why I decided to GTFO of the military.

When I joined the military, I was very into the idea of joining a brotherhood, where every one looked out for each other. Maybe that was something that was true in the past, but my experiences were mostly the opposite, an ""every person for themselves"" attitude seemed to prevail. I had just sewn on SSGT a few months prior. I was in an aircraft maintenance squadron that worked on older planes, and there was another squadron that worked on newer aircraft.

I know this is some stupid chair force story about a meeting, so go ahead with the jokes lol

One day I was told that I was going to be working with the other ""newer"" squadron to help get their failure rates down. I thought this was gonna be awesome, cause we were all the military ready to fucking wrestle down some inter-squadron problem. This was going to be a week long workshop, where people from both squadrons would meet in a room and jam out details of what we could do better.

I don't remember the details of every day, but I remember trying to help this other squadron out with some ideas. One of my ideas was to fix the slides on the CBT because I knew a lot of them had outdated info on them. I was immediately yelled at by a SRA from the ""newer"" squadron with ""IF YOU CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THE SLIDES WHY DON'T YOU UPDATE THEM"".

Jesus fucking christ! Why the fuck are you yelling at me?!! I look around and all the ""newer"" squadron people are just glaring at me, giving me the biggest stink-eye I've ever seen.  In hindsight, I think that all the ""newer"" squadron were just tired of their commander bitching at them about stupid numbers (it was like a 5% error rate) Anyways, I am too much of a softy so I take the hint and me and the other people from my squadron just shut up and take the week to relax.

It's okay though because all those ""newer"" squadron assholes got what was coming to them.

Friday rolls around and it's time for the assholes to present to the commander what we worked on all week right? Well, ""we"" didn't work on anything because they were such assholes. So they centered their presentation around the idea that ""5% isn't indicative of anything so there's not really a problem."" They start talking and before it even gets to the second person, the commander stops them mid-sentence and yells at all of them for being stupid.

We could have just pretend to fix something small like I wanted, but no, ya'll wanted to make it seem like the commander is stupid.

I just grinned at all of them. Assholes.

Apparently, a muffled cry was heard to emanate from his office, when he discovered the large turd inside his uniform hat. The turd was creatively decorated by the turd burglar who had stuck  the Chief Superintendent’s epaulettes into the turd, creating the finishing touches. 

He didn’t have the option of getting a new hat and epaulettes as he had to get to the Yard ASAP.

"212","I still believe in, and love America. Not the geographic borders, or the fortunate accident of my birth of being born inside them. I mean the greater metaphysical concept of what it is to be an American. I do have a very complicated love/hate relationship with Americans as a people, finding them often to fulfill many of the negative international cultural stereotypes. But I love the spirit of independence, the endless optimism, the generosity, and ideals enshrined (and occasionally even upheld) in our Constitution. But one of the things that I love the most is that almost anyone can become one of us.

Shortly before my Afghanistan deployment I spent a few weeks in Mozambique training peacekeepers for the African Union. Well, that’s what I supposed to do, but I didn’t end up doing that. My unit sent me there because I was the “Subject Matter Expert” (SME) on Mozambican affairs. How did I become the SME on Mozambique you ask? While overhearing a conversation between two officers about an upcoming training mission in Southeast Africa, I suggested the take SPC Fabio (Name Changed), as he was born and raised in Brazil. The paraphrased conversation cemented my position as an expert.

“Why the fuck would we want to send SPC Fabio? He’s from Brazil, Mozambique is in Africa. They speak some African language. Stop eavesdropping and get back to work”

“You do know that Mozambique is a former Portuguese colony, right? And that their national language is still Portuguese…..”

*Long Pause*

“What else do you know about Mozambique?”

“Not that much. Colonial history, geography, exports, I’m more up on South Africa though”

“Well, I guess the both of you are going. Fabio as he speaks the language and you because you know more about Mozambique than anyone else here. Pack your shit, you leave in 3 months”

My small detachment arrived in Mozambique at the beginning of summer/their winter and linked up with the Marine rifle regiment that would be conducting most of the training. Initially, the Marines were just as foreign and incomprehensible as the Mozambicans, but after learning their language of exaggerated gestures and grunting noises, we were able to communicate with our beloved jarheads. All joking about inter-service rivalries aside, the Marines were a joy to work with. Watching them do weird things like bayonet practice with live bayonets or drinking hot sauce was all part of the mission’s entertainment.

They managed to get *all* my attention while setting up an expeditionary water filtration system in the local river. To do this a Marine PFC waded out deep into the river to set a weighted hose to suck up the river water away from the bank. The river water then passes through some magical box that makes the water drinkable. What was more interesting to me, was the Marine PFC wading through obviously crocodile infested waters. This was obvious because of the signs warning of crocodile attack, and the locals hooting warnings from the opposite side of the river, and the crocodiles that were clearly swimming in the river. When I pointed this out to the Marine SGT in charge of the detail (in particular, I emphatically gestured to the ACTUAL CROCODILES in the water), he calmly spit out his dip and said “It’s ok, he doesn’t have any sensitive items on him”……Fucking Marines.

SPC Fabio quickly made himself indispensable, as he was the only American service member who was fluent in Portuguese. Honestly, that is selling him short. He’s also older and wiser than the average SPC (10 years older than me in fact), has traveled all over the world, speaks five languages, and has this amazing ability to magically get shit done. He also has this supernatural sixth sense that no matter where we are, he seems to always find other Brazilians even in exotic locations such as Maputo, Mogadishu, Kandahar and Dallas. I’ve witnessed this inter-Brazilian radar on many occasions, and it never ceases to amaze me.

My friend also has a massive leg up on most of the US born troops in that he grew up, quite literally in the Amazon jungle. He understands the people of the developing world that we work with, because he grew up in a similar environment. It’s not unusual for him to casually bring up in conversation the age he was when he owned his first pair of shoes (14), the number of times he had malaria (5), and the number of anacondas he has killed in defense of hearth and home (many). His language skills, life experience, innate problem-solving abilities and work ethic make him the best Soldier I’ve ever commanded. And finally, since the Marines don’t have the rank of Specialist, his funny (Army) uniform and strange rank insignia further impressed our local allies and marked him out as someone even more unique.

He was called in to solve and fix all sorts of problems from the mundane to the serious. Initially, the Marines were providing the Mozambican soldiers with 3 Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) a day. Now, I’m sure many of you in the crowd are shaking you head at that already. Americans can’t eat 3 of these things a day. The locals were going digestively bonkers trying to process this amazing caloric windfall. And they were eating the silicon packets. And drinking the hot sauce. And burning themselves with the chemical heaters. So SPC Fabio conducted an amazingly informative class on how to eat food that I’m sure literally saved lives.

After mastering the ins and outs of MREs the Marine cooks began providing prepared meals and materials to the locals. The first cross cultural hiccup occurred when they provided them with several giant bags (the size of pillows), of powdered eggs. Just add water and you get that lovely egg slime you know and remember from overseas service. The Mozambicans were instantly skeptical of this white man sorcery. They know what eggs look like. They know what yellow dust looks like, and they noted the lack of similarity between the two. So, again SPC Fabio sat down with the Marine cooks and Mozambican cooks and provided a series of Brazilian Gordon Ramseyesque classes on military cooking in an industrial field kitchen.

In a matter of days, it became obvious to the Mozambicans that SPC Fabio was the real brains behind the entire American operation in Mozambique. The local officers would ignore Marine colonels and majors, brushing past them to talk to my lowly E4. More amusing to me, they thought I was the Fabio's assistant, and I did exactly nothing to dissuade them of that notion. It was a lot of fun, pretending to be Fabio’s valet. Carrying things for him, getting him drinks during meetings, taking notes for him. Ultimately, it was more efficient this way. Me trying to step in and assert authority or add a link in the chain of translation wouldn’t have helped anything.

After operations were established and SPC Fabio got us everything we needed (including roughly half of the buildings on camp) he and I departed to work with a mobile medical clinic that would travel the countryside near the training area, winning hearts and minds with modern medicine. Well, that’s what the doctors were doing. I was stimulating the local economy by purchasing soda, food, and souvenirs on behalf of the Marines, Airmen and Sailors who weren’t allowed beyond the barbed wire. When I found time, I helped organize and triage the patients, coordinated with local leaders to streamline the patient in processing, collected medical statistics, created language translation pamphlets, and planned operations for the next village we planned to visit.

Shortly before our departure from Mozambique, the mobile medical clinic returned to the main training camp. I collected my first non-MRE/non-local meal in weeks, my first shower, and my first non-solar powered electrical socket to recharge my phone and camera. As I walked around camp with SPC Fabio, we were repeatedly approached by Mozambican soldiers. They wanted to talk to us, strangers from strange lands in their native Portuguese. Fabio with his natural knack of friend making and storytelling regaled them with descriptions of life in America, the ultimate land of wine and honey. I like to think that hearing these stories from Fabio, an immigrant to America, carried a greater significance to those Africans. We sat and talked for hours with them, under a light pollution free starry sky. My friend pointed out the Milky Way and named for me all the constellations of the Southern Hemisphere that he grew up under in Rondônia.

On one of our last mornings at the camp, I was walking down the dirt road from the training classroom to my pup tent with Fabio. We saw a formation of Mozambican soldiers marching toward us with the glorious swagger and grandiose movements of a nation influenced by Soviet military traditions. Legs kicking high, arms swinging, necks rigid, and faces frozen in masks of solemn pride. Adhering to military custom Fabio and I stepped off the road and snapped to the position of Parade Rest as the formation passed.

The officer in charge of the formation saluted and shouted “Isto e Fabio, O Brasileiro! Olhos Direito!” (It’s Fabio! The Brazilian! Eyes Right). The entire formation in one solid movement snapped their necks 90 degrees to render honors and salute the humble Army Specialist from the deepest jungles of the Amazon. Another company of soldiers followed the first, and the cry and salutes was repeated. Fabio snapped to attention and saluted the officer of each passing company. His returned salutes became more and more grandiose causing some of the local soldiers began to cheer and whoop. “I think it’s their entire regiment” he said, with a smirk “Do they know?” he asked me. I stood a respectful half step behind and to the side of him, as a fake subordinate should. “Know what?” I replied.

“You know, my real rank, who I really am? That I’m not an *American* American ”

“Doesn’t matter to them bud. Look at them. If they do know, they don’t care.”

We watched the remainder of the formation pass, stamping off and leaving us in a blood red earth dust cloud of their own creation. I smiled at Fabio, and we both knew the charade was coming to an end. At home, he’d go back to being one of the most junior guys in the battalion, and not the celebrity he was in Mozambique. For a few weeks in our little fairy-tale land, he was more than a Specialist, he was THE King. We would deploy together 3 more times. Afghanistan and twice more to Africa. He proved his value on every deployment and is one of the best soldiers and men I know. Our country is blessed to have men like him. Americans are born all over the world, every day…. some of them just haven’t come home yet.

The other day I watched the mad scramble at Hamid Karzai International Airport, and the tragic and ignominious end of Americas longest war. I watched coverage of planeloads of Afghans fleeing the country, most of whom worked with NATO forces for the noble but Sisyphean goal of bringing the light of democracy, enlightenment, and equality to their blood-soaked land. I wept as I watched the dream of a democratic and free Afghanistan die on the dusty tarmac. I weep when I think of all that we lost, the lives shattered, forever changed, the loss of innocence of millions the world over who traveled to that nation and tried to do righteous deeds. Through all the painful coverage I watched, I received what I felt like were heartfelt, but ultimately empty, platitudes from senior military leaders and politicians, from my family and non-veteran friends. It all rang hollow as I sat on my couch weeping, unable to look away and feeling an indescribable feeling of loss.

But then yesterday I saw something. A picture of a little girl, wrapped in an Air Force uniform jacket, napping in the cargo hold of a C17. I blinked back my tears and realized something. While we lost Afghanistan, we gained *her*. *She* will be an American. She is too young to realize it, she isn’t *leaving* home, she is *coming* home. In the belly of that C17, I stopped seeing refugees. I started seeing Americans. Men and women who were born as Afghans, who strived and suffered with their blood, sweat and tears to grow a better nation, but failed. The tragic loss of Afghanistan is our gain, as their best and brightest follow the setting sun westward over the horizon. We are gaining men and women who will be the best Americans and they are coming *home*.

In in our nation, we strive so that a person’s worth isn’t measured by their tribe. Here we won’t care about their ethnicity, skin color, or religion. They are not the sum of their wealth, title, or property. In our land, a foreign stranger, a penniless immigrant seeking a new life in distant lands, an American by *CHOICE*, not by the luck of birth, can arise to become anything. Who knows what our newest Americans will become? They could follow in the footsteps of many selfless and brave immigrants and join the military of their new home. And maybe with just the right amount of luck, they could be just like my friend, who at the right place, in the right moment, for just a few weeks, was the King of Mozambique.","11248"

"216","Due to an insane amount of luck and some fortunate interpersonal relationships I got stationed in Poland. I cannot overstate how lucky my posting in Poland was. I had an extremely easy job, in the beautiful city of Poznan, working for some amazing superiors, with entirely too many privileges and too much time off. This assignment hit at just the right time in my life, as I quit my civilian, ended a relationship, and didn’t want to stay in America. Considering I had just returned from my second Africa deployment, leaving for Poland with less than 60 days stateside seemed like just the right idea. 

Someday I’ll write more about Poland and how their wonderful of a country helped me process and relax after too many deployments to war torn and desperate lands. The Polish people are a wonderfully welcoming bunch, especially for me being culturally Catholic with an Eastern European surname. Their hospitality, food, beer, history and culture are second to none.  But those stories are for another day. This story is about a lovely 4-day weekend in Berlin, and some of the life lessons I learned there. 

I was privileged to get a 4-day weekend at least once a month while stationed in Poland, and for those of you who can look at a map, you’ll see that Poznan Poland is just a short train or bus ride away from Berlin. Whenever I visit a new city in Europe I book a daytime walking tour of historical sites, and a nighttime walking tour of breweries, distilleries and wineries. It’s a great way to get the historical and cultural city by day, and a great way to meet other drunken English-speaking tourists by night. A funny thing I learned was how much of a “Bridge-language” English is. On the English-speaking tours, you meet people from all over the world, who jump onto the English tours because it’s a convenient second language. I have a vivid memory of a gentleman from Chile, whose wife was from Slovakia on a beer tour in Prague. Neither of them could speak their partners native tongues, but they got along well enough in English to make a marriage out of it. I complimented the man, who must have been smooth as hell, for not only picking up, but managing to seduce and marry a woman in their shared second language. 

On my German beer tour in what was formerly East Berlin, my traveling companion (my Sergeant-Major) and I met a fascinating couple. He was Danish; she was a Venezuelan refuge who had immigrated to Denmark, and they were very much in love and happily married vacationing in Berlin. Like many Europeans from Scandinavia, they spoke oddly unaccented English. I’m not kidding, it took several rounds of questions and answers and beers before we could detect any trace of an accent. Even more interesting to me and my buddy, the gentleman was formerly an officer in the Royal Danish Army and had served in Afghanistan in the same AO roughly the same time that I had. 

This story is something of a love letter to the NATO allies (And Non-NATO allies, for the Ausies and Kiwis) from an American Soldier. I had limited exposure to them in Afghanistan, other than the Canadian medevac unit and Belgian close air support. I remember seeing on a whiteboard, the various breakdowns of what medical units would fly in what conditions. Some medical choppers wouldn’t fly in inclement weather, some wouldn’t land in a hot LZ. The Canadian medevac unit had an asterisk next to their conditions that simply said “Will Fly”.  Air is red? *”Will Fly”, hot LZ? *”Will Fly” I always felt a little better 
when I saw that they were the supporting element. I also have some happy memories of Belgian F-16s dropping ordinance on Taliban positions, as I watched from the rooftop of my local Afghan government building. 

I get the general impression that it’s not easy being a NATO member, dragged into American wars, usually for American interests. Article Five has been implemented only once, for Afghanistan, and I always wondered what it was like for a Lithuanian, Italian or Pole to lay it all on the line for the destruction of the World Trade Center. Most of them don’t get close to the pay of the average American grunt, and very few of them get the quality equipment that the average American Soldier or Marine gets. Almost none of them get the cultural support or thanks from their countrymen.

I have something of a love-hate relationship with the hero-worship of American military personnel that happens in our culture. I love that I get 10% at Home Depot, but I hate just about everything else about it. It might be because I’m a cranky Yankee from New England, a region that has the lowest enlistment rates for military service, and the few that join, usually join the Navy or Marines. With most military bases being in the deep south, I’ve always felt a double cultural disconnect, firstly for being a northerner, secondly for the instant displays of gratitude and admiration that being a military member seems to get you in that part of the country. I believe that it is generally authentic, but it almost feels compulsory, which takes some of the honesty out of it. Nothing like this exists in Europe as far as I am aware. 

After a few rounds of beers paid for by myself and my sergeant major, the Danish veteran began to share stories of his time in Afghanistan with us. Other than the faintest hint of an accent, that grew aided by several liters of good German beer, his stories were much the same as our stories. Stories that transcend silly things like borders and culture, stories that only other Soldiers could know and understand. After an hour or so, I dipped out for a smoke and shortly after lighting up I felt a tap on my shoulder.   It was his wife. She didn’t smoke, but she wanted to share a message with me and my friend. 

She explained to us that in Denmark, a tiny country with less than 50,000 people in their entire military, that he never gets to speak with other veterans. So few Danish soldiers have served in Afghanistan, or on peacekeeping missions elsewhere. On the very rare occasion he met with other veterans, they were Danish soldiers that he had served with, all the stories were recycled, and the general attitude was that it was a job that needed doing, by men that did it. In all his veteran experience, he had never experienced people buying him free drinks for the price of his stories and his service.  

As I walked back to our table I saw my Sergeant Major with an arm around the Dane, laughing and sharing jokes it reminded me of the hundreds of nights I shared with my friends during my service. I again thought of how rare and fleeting those moment must be for my NATO comrades after they leave their military service. In my travels I’ve never seen a European VFW or American Legion Hall. Outside of America I’ve only been offered a military discount once, deep in the Yukon driving the Alaska-Canada highway a small hotel where they offered a discount to any person who showed military credentials, regardless of their nation of origin. I wondered if this is because after centuries of war, most Europeans prefer not to be reminded of their bloody histories, and prefer to politely ignore their armies, half ugly necessity, half relic of the past. 

In late February as I drove to up to Anchorage to fly away for my academy I listened to the radio as war erupted in Ukraine, shattering almost 80 years of peace in Europe. The end of The Long Peace. This new war, the same as the last major war that tore through Europe was started by an evil and maniacal megalomaniac, with the goal to eradicate a people, a culture and their nation. And in this war, the same as the last, the free peoples of Europe have upheld their commitment to the defense of budding democracies.

In July I drove home south on the same highway, again listening to the radio as the war rages on. The Ukrainian people to my great surprise, and shame of my doubt, have held their own against the Russian Federation. For the first time in my life, I see an up-swell of support in the NATO nations for their armies and for the alliance that had kept the peace for decades since the end of the last great war. I wonder if on the streets of Berlin, Paris and Copenhagen if young people walk past recruiting offices and stop, stare and find their spines straightening. I wonder if the veterans of those units with ancient lineages, whose colors carry battle streamers older than my country, watch the news with pride and awe. I wonder what tomorrow will bring in Europe, for the brave men and women of Ukraine. 

Some days I wake up and look wistfully to the east and I wonder how far our countries will go in support of the Ukrainian people. Would NATO go beyond their commitment of Lend Lease and training and advising the armed forces of Ukraine. Will I see another war? Do I even want to? And would a war in the defense of a people and their homes erase the lingering feelings of shame and doubt I have over Iraq and Afghanistan. Thousands of American and NATO veterans have answered these questions to themselves and are now serving in Ukraine in defense of naked aggression against a free and democratic country. I wonder if my Danish friend asks the same questions as I do. What should be done by the nations of NATO? How deep is our commitment to the ideals and philosophies of our alliance? And what is the cost that the world must pay to honor the promise that small nations might be free……

"217","Ok this is a life lesson and some advice. Please forgive my shitty NJ education. 

Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the one nutt wonder. 

So I was station in the the shithole state know as California. Anyways I go to work to get the daily pass-ons before I conduct guardmount. We get a report of a runaway teenage girl. Fast forward I'm searching the paintball field on our base as I'm walking around looking for this kid. When the call comes over the radio that they found her and she's trying to run away from my Airman at the gate. As I'm running back to my vehicle I feel a sharp pain in my growing area but push through cause this kid is trying to run away again. Anyways return the kid to her parents and the rest of the night goes by with no drama. I go home shower and sleep when I wake up for my morning piss I feel this horrible pain and I look down and my right nutt is big as fuck. So I do what every man does I look at web MD. The 1st thing it said about my oversized right nutt is I got 30 minutes to get to the ER or I'm going to die. So I brush my teeth and head straight to the ER freaking out.

So I get to the ER go inside talk to the admin at the desk and they take me to back faster then normal which now has me freaking out even more. So  the doc comes in and ask why I'm there I told him why he asked if he can see. So before I drop my shorts I say no homo which he didn't find to funny but it's whatever. When he sees it he like whatever but when he felt it the look on his face changed. That's when I knew something was bad. He ask when was the last time I had sex. I said a bout 2 months (the ex wife and I were over each other and I didn't want to stick my dick in her anymore) he said it could be gonorrhea. I told him if it's gonorrhea they better open another bed next to me cause I'm going to beat my ex wife's ass jokingly. So he runs some test and it's worst then gonorrhea it's ball cancer. So as he's telling me this a hot medic chick walks in to take some blood sample and what not.

As she doing that the doc is going down what the procedure will be like and ask if I had any questions. I said I have one and asked if they will replace my homie righty. The doc said yes. So I ask if I can get one with a bell and lights so girls can hear and see me cumming. Doc didn't laugh hot medic chick busted out laughing and said she would be down to see that. Anyways they remove righty the next day and I didn't get my bell with lights fake ball. 

Morale of the story is check your nutts once a month or have your SO do it for you. Ball cancer sucks!","11941"
"218","&gt;And EVERY SINGLE TIME the NCO's in the area would walk away, finding something else to do. Because they knew I was in the E4 Mafia doing some Mafia shit, and they didn't want to get involved.

Just googled E4 Mafia and according to the top hit, that's rule number one:

[7 unofficial rules that the E4 Mafia lives by](https://www.wearethemighty.com/popular/lance-corporal-underground-rules/)

&gt;See nothing, say nothing

&gt;The very first and most important law of the E4 Mafia is this: Plausible deniability is your best friend. These simple words can be used in almost every situation.

&gt;In the military, if you see someone doing something against regulations, you’re supposed to say something. But are you really going to call out your bros for putting their hands in their pockets when it’s cold outside? Hell no.","12194"
